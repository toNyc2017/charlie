Construction Engineering (Burns and McDonnell, Advanced Engineering Associates Intl, Vinci, Quantas, Larson & Toubro)	


Analysis

Overall: Out of the 15.15% exposure in the Industrial and Transportation sector, 13.1% is in Transportation, while only 2.0% is in Industrials which is further concentrated in only three names (CAT, DE, SIEGY)

Transportation:  Transportation investments heavily focused on moving people and less so on freight. Only minimal railroads and no trucking, marine transportation, or air freight/logistics (although UPS, DHL in DVP).
Industrials: Missing significant subsectors with strong macro theme: construction engineering, commercial and professional services, industrial conglomerates, building products, defense.  

Macroeconomic Background:
Macroeconomic Background:

The Economy and the Transportation and Industrial Sectors: 	
The components of the Transportation and Industrials sectors in which SCP has decided to invest (Planes/Aerospace, Automotive, Railroads, Construction Machinery and Equipment, Robotics & Automation) are all closely tied to the overall macroeconomic health of the economy. Most directly, these sectors combined represent over 20% of the economy. The Transportation sector represents about 5.6% of GDP, Industrials about 17.9% of GDP (of which manufacturing is 11.4%), and Aerospace about 1.7% of GDP. These sectors also are highly correlated with overall economic growth and their relative vibrancy is often seen as a barometer of economic health.  When GDP expands, there is typically higher demand for these goods and services, which leads in turn to higher industrial production (and vice versa).
The overall health of the Industrials subsectors are also closely tied to macroeconomic policy choices made by state and federal policy makers:

Protectionism/Fair vs. Free Trade: Not surprisingly, these sectors are jealously guarded by policy makers and regulators and protectionism in the form of trade tariffs and export-import regulations is common.  In general, such protectionism can hinder overall economic growth and depress the overall economy. On the other hand, unchecked unfair competition from heavily subsidized foreign sectors (e.g., as has been alleged for Chinese EVs) can also negatively impact the sectors and the economy.  Policy makers must try to pursue a “middle path” that encourages “fair trade” without overly restricting “free trade.”
Monetary Policy:  These sectors are also sensitive to changes in interest rates, as higher rates increase borrowing costs, discouraging investment in industrial expansion.  To the extent that we expect higher for longer rates, this will serve as a drag on performance for SCP’s holdings in these sectors.  

Fiscal Policy: Government spending on infrastructure, defense, and other industrial projects also directly impacts these sectors, providing a critical and reliable customer base for products.  

Regulatory Policy:  Given their importance, these sectors are also highly exposed to regulatory policy.  On the upside, governments will quite often provide considerable subsidies and tax breaks in order to spur these sectors or encourage their geographic relocation. On the downside, the government also hopes to direct the future path for these sectors, for example by passing ever higher fuel efficiency requirements for autos produced in the U.S. in order to address climate change.
As with the Energy, Healthcare, and Technology sectors, therefore, the future health of the Transportation and Industrial sectors will be highly dependent upon the creation of effective public-private partnerships. In turn, successful companies must have considerable global regulatory expertise in order to maximize potential benefits and minimize harms.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution and the Industrial Sector	
As noted in SCP’s Technology Macro Theme, many analysts suggest that we are in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (also called Industry.4.0 or 4IR). McKinsey defines Industry 4.0 as “the next phase in the digitization of the manufacturing sector, driven by disruptive trends including the rise of data and connectivity, analytics, human-machine interaction, advanced robotics, augmented reality, machine automation, and more.”  It argues that such technology has already been transforming global business, at least since the mid-2010s, but that it still holds significant promise for the future of operations and production.
Industry 4.0 is a key component of SCP’s macro outlook. Improvements in productivity made through Industry 4.0 technological advancements can push the supply curve out, increasing the output of goods and services, leading to lower prices and a long-term, stable rate of inflation.  Indeed, such a scenario will need to be a critical component of how the U.S. addresses its debt crisis, reducing the need to “inflate” or “cut” our way out of our predicament. 

The case for technological transformation is particularly strong in manufacturing, automotive, aerospace and defense, construction equipment, and logistics and transport sectors, each of which relies on complex manufacturing processes and supply chains and, therefore, have the potential for data-driven optimization.   There are a number of promising technologies coming in play currently which hold great promise for such productivity enhancements, including:
Automation and Robotics: Advanced robotics are used to perform tasks with high precision and consistency. Automation technologies increase productivity and safety while reducing human error and labor costs. Utilizing automation and robotics in industrial settings can streamline processes, increase efficiency and enhance safety.

Big Data and Analytics: The ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data allows companies to optimize operations, better forecast demand, improve product quality, and make data-driven decisions.  	

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning: AI and machine learning algorithms can analyze data, predict outcomes, and optimize processes. In manufacturing, AI can improve quality control, enable predictive maintenance, and enhance supply chain management. 

3D Printing/Additive Manufacturing: This technology enables the production of complex parts and prototypes with reduced waste and shorter lead times.
Internet of Things (IoT)/Predictive Maintenance: IoT technology enables industrial machines and equipment to communicate and exchange data with each other and with other systems in real-time, providing valuable data that can be used to optimize operations.  IoT facilitates real-time monitoring and control of machinery and systems, leading to improved efficiency.  

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):  AR and VR technologies can be used for training, maintenance, and design purposes (e.g., overlaying digital info onto the physical world to guide technicians during repairs).

Cyber-Physicial Systems (CPS): CPS integrates physical machinery with computational algorithms, leading to more responsive and adaptive manufacturing processes.
Cloud and Edge Computing: Cloud computing provides scalable and flexible storage and processing power without the need for extensive on-site IT infrastructure.  Complementing cloud computing, edge computing processes data closer to the source of generation (e.g., on machines, sensors, computers, or phones).  This reduces latency and bandwidth usage, allowing for faster decision-making and real-time processing.  

Digital Twins: A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical asset, system, or process.  It allows manufacturers to simulate, monitor, and optimize performance in a virtual environment before implementing changes in the real world.  This assists design, operation and maintenance.

Advanced Materials: The development of advanced materials such as composites, ceramics, and superalloys has led to lighter, stronger, and more energy efficient products across the Transportation and Industrial sectors.
Renewable Energy Technologies: The Transportation and Industrial sectors are also increasingly adopting renewable energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage systems, hydrogen fuel cells, biofuels, and synthetic fuels.  

Blockchain: Blockchain technology has the potential to streamline supply chain management and create a secure and immutable record of transactions.

Smart Infrastructure: Applying AI and data analytics to major infrastructure projects, including building the next generation electrical grid, offers tremendous opportunities to improve efficiency and safety.

Cybersecurity: The increasing digitization of critical industrial processes also creates ever larger opportunities for cyber-terrorism and each of the sectors must be proactive in engineering around these threats.	


In addition to the previous list, additional critical technology advances for the Transportation sector include:
Electric Vehicles (EVs):  Improvements in battery life, charging speed and energy density are making EVs more practical and affordable.  Similarly, ongoing expansion of charging networks is increasing the convenience of use. EVs include battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).  PHEVs and HEVs are likely to outpace BEVs until further improvements are made in battery life, vehicle ranges, and charging infrastructure. 	

Autonomous Vehicles: Advancements in AI and sensor technology are bringing fully autonomous vehicles closer to reality, although it is not yet clear if and when these technologies will come to fruition. 	

High Speed Rail: Technologies such as maglev trains and trains that run on renewable energy offer faster, quieter, and more energy-efficient rail transport.	

Major technology trends for the Aerospace industry (not already mentioned above) include:
Major technology trends for the Aerospace industry (not already mentioned above) include:

Electric and Hybrid Propulsion: The push for more sustainable aviation solutions (discussed below) is leading to the development of electric and hybrid propulsion systems.

Autonomous and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Drones and UAVs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, moving beyond military application to commercial uses such as goods delivery.  

Satellite Technology and Space Exploration: Advances in satellite technology are improving global communication, weather forecasting and earth observation.  Increasing interest in space exploration is creating opportunities for private companies to contribute to these endeavors.
To generate sufficient productivity enhancements to support growth rates sufficient to allow policymakers to address the US debt crisis, it will be critical for the Transportation and Industrial sectors to capitalize upon these generational changes in technology. From a company perspective, SCP also expects that those best able to integrate Industry 4.0 developments will outperform their peers. According to a 2018 McKinsey Global Institute analysis, Industry 4.0 front-runners—facilities well on their way to adopting AI and other advanced technologies by 2025—can expect a . Follower companies can expect just 10 percent, while companies that wholly fail to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies could see a 23 percent downturn.
Global Climate Change and the Industrial Sector
In a prior macroeconomic analysis, SCP discussed the critical role that the electric power industry will play in the overall efforts to address global climate change. According to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990–2022 (the national inventory that the U.S. prepares annually under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), electric power generation accounts for fully 25% of total U.S. GHG emissions. The leading economic sector contributing GHG emissions, however, is Transportation, which accounted for 28% of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2022.  Of this, the aerospace sector accounted for roughly 2.5% of GHG emissions.  The Industrial sector accounted for another 23% of GHG emissions. Combined then, the Transportation and Industrial sectors represent just over half of all emissions, and when you take into account electricity end-use indirect emissions, the number rises to just below 60%.  It is clear, therefore, that making the Transportation
the number rises to just below 60%.  It is clear, therefore, that making the Transportation and Industrial sectors more sustainable is a necessary precondition to meeting ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets.

Infrastructure and the Industrial Sector
After decades of underinvestment, the U.S. and many other developed countries have seen their critical infrastructure fall into relative obsolescence and disrepair.  Much of the U.S. infrastructure, including roads, bridges, public transportation, the electrical grid, water systems, broadband internet, and public transportation was built decades ago. The American Society of Civil Engineers’ most recent infrastructure report card gave the U.S. a C-, reflecting ongoing infrastructure deterioration. The scale of investment required to rebuild and modernize critical U.S. infrastructure, however, is daunting, particularly at a time when the country is facing an alarming debt crisis. The recently passed (11/2021) Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) made a significant downpayment on this critical funding gap, funding approximately $1.2 trillion of investments, with $550 billion in the next five years.  Even this massive bill,
$1.2 trillion of investments, with $550 billion in the next five years.  Even this massive bill, however, falls short, with the ASCE estimating that $4.6 trillion of investments will be required to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure.  Eventually, policymakers will need to come to grips with this significant funding gap.  As they do, this will represent a significant government put for industrial manufacturers involved in the infrastructure renewal.
Subsector Investment Thesis:	
  	
SCP has extensive connectivity with the Transportation and Industrials sectors. Consistent with the macroeconomic view above, SCP is focusing its investments in (1) companies which can commercialize the most promising Industry 4.0 technologies and shift out the country’s supply curve, (2) companies which can lead these sectors in a more sustainable direction and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (3) companies poised to take advantage of the significant amount of infrastructure investment required in the years ahead, and (4) companies that can effectively work in a public-private partnership and navigate the complicated trade, fiscal, regulatory and monetary policy frameworks.
In addition to these globally relevant trends, SCP is also looking at the investment case on a subsector by subsector basis. SCP has focused its investments in five critical subsectors: Planes/Aerospace, Automobiles/Trucks, Railroads, Construction Machinery and Equipment, and Robotics & Automation.
Planes/Aerospace: SCP is focusing heavily on the commercial aircraft market which is governed by a essential duopoly of Airbus and Boeing, is heavily subsidized by governments globally, and is therefore able to earn higher than market rents. Given the long backlogs for new planes and the resulting need to refurbish the existing fleet, SCP is also bullish on the leading Aerospace Components/Equipment suppliers. There is also a strong macro case in favor of the Defense Aerospace subsector given growing regional hostilities; to date, however, SCP has not focused on companies in this space.  While bullish on this sector, SCP is also cognizant of higher for longer rates and the trend away from ownership, which can limit demand for  aircraft (and conversely is driving growth in the aircraft leasing sector).
Automotive: In general, SCP believes the automotive companies are relatively inexpensive, particularly given their significant free cash flow and shareholder payouts. More specifically, SCP is identifying automakers which it believes can best manage the transition from the internal combustion engine to electric power drives.  These include the two leading all-electric vehicle manufacturers, Tesla and .  It also includes a number of the traditional automakers who are making the requisite investments to manage the transition well, with particular attention on manufacturers who have robust hybrid and plug-in hybrid offerings, which SCP sees as a stepping stone toward all electric options until such time as BEV driving ranges improve and charging infrastructure is built out. Finally, SCP is favorable toward companies that are well positioned in the evolving luxury subsegment of the market.  Higher for longer rates, however, also raise the costs of financing for both automakers and their
Higher for longer rates, however, also raise the costs of financing for both automakers and their consumers, dampening demand somewhat, particularly for higher cost EVs.  This is offset somewhat by recent tax incentives offered in the U.S.
Railroads: SCP is bullish on the railroad sector, given high degree of consolidation, particularly among Class I railways, stable profits, significant free cash flow, and importance to cross-continental goods transport (particularly North-South routes).  It also serves as a good inflation hedge to the portfolio. The sector should benefit from government spending on infrastructure, environmental sustainability and reshoring efforts for manufacturing.  Labor issues may serve as an impediment to growth, however.  

Construction Machinery & Equipment: SCP is bullish on this sector as it believes that it will be a primary beneficiary of the large infrastructure investments being made globally (see below).  It is also a sector that stands to benefit from Industry 4.0 technologies significantly, particularly robotics and automation. With that said, this sector has run up significantly as the market recognizes these same trends (although less so for Deere and Caterpillar).
Robotics and Automation: The drive toward smart factories is driving demand for robotics and automation, although the market is focused on short-term pragmatic applications rather than long-term visionary concepts.

These aircraft find applications in surveillance, delivery, defense, and data collection. Trends in the aerospace market for autonomous aircraft involve the development of advanced artificial intelligence, improved sensors, and increasingly stringent regulatory frameworks to support safe and expanded use in various industries, such as e-commerce, agriculture, and defense.
Aircraft Leasing Market	
 The Aircraft Leasing market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by airlines seeking cost management strategies, increasing levels of air travel, the shift toward more sustainable aviation practices/fleet modernization, and the growing demand for regional jets in emerging markets.  Similar to autos, this marks a trend away from ownership, which will only be bolstered by higher for longer rates  The market is expected to grow from $178.3 billion in 2023 to $401.7 billion in 2032, a CAGR of 11.1% (Source: Fortune Business Insights).  Europe represents the largest market, although North America is projected to have a higher growth rate.  Major players in Aircraft Leasing include AerCap, Air Lease Corporation, BOC Aviation, BBAM, GE Capital Aviation Services, among others.

Possible Subsector Tailwinds:
Possible Subsector Tailwinds: 	

Robust Demand for Commercial Aviation: After weathering the pandemic, which hit the commercial air travel markets deeply, analysts see significant growth in the demand for commercial aircraft moving forward, particularly in emerging markets which are experiencing growth in middle-class populations and urbanization. Boeing projects global demand for 42,595 new aircraft between 2023-2042. Annual average fleet growth will be 3.5% over this period, while overall air traffic will grow by 6.1%. This compares to global economic growth estimates of 2.6%.   Growth rates will exceed average in Asia, while underperforming average in North America.  Three quarters of this demand will be for single aisle, fuel-efficient airplanes, with Low-Cost Carriers growing to comprise 40% of this fleet (see below).  Wide-bodied plans make up the balance of the demand, driven by the rebound in international air traffic.
Rise of Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) and Ultra Low Cost Carriers (ULCCs): The number of LCCs and ULCCs continues to grow, particularly across Asian markets.  Their lower fares are making air travel more accessible to increasing numbers of consumers worldwide, a key driver for long-term air travel growth outpacing economic growth.  This is driving demand for single-aisle, fuel-efficient aircraft in particular.

Essential Duopoly:  By a large margin, Airbus and Boeing are the world’s two largest commercial aircraft manufacturers, enjoying a 63% and 37% market share respectively in the commercial jet subsector. In addition, both companies  from their respective governments.  As a result, they are able to exercise considerable oligopolistic pricing power.
Large Backlogs for Commercial Aircraft:  Airbus and Boeing both have large order backlogs, reflecting that customers have virtually no other options given the essential duopoly.  As of May 2024, Airbus had a backlog of 8.600 orders and has had a larger backlog than Boeing every year since 2000.  To get a sense of just how large this number is, in May 2024 Airbus delivered 53 planes to 34 customers and received 27 gross orders, meaning its backlog only decreased by 26.  While smaller than Airbus’, Boeing’s backlog is 5,660 planes, including 4,783 MAX aircraft, as of December 31, 2023.  In May 2024, Boeing’s backlog declined to 5,625 from 5,646 in April, a decline of only 21. Notably, the Company received only one new order for four jets in May, compared to seven planes in April.
Global Unrest/Defense Spending: As global tensions rise, so does global defense spending.  Governments worldwide are prioritizing enhancing their military capabilities, fueling demand for such items as advanced aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), satellite-enabled defense technologies, etc.  The growth in government spending is projected to outpace that of the commercial sector, albeit starting from a smaller base.  This bodes well for the defense aerospace companies.
Significant Opportunities in Space:  McKinsey estimates that the global space economy will grow from $630B in 2023 to $1.8 trillion by 2035.  This figure includes both “backbone” applications—such as those for satellites, launchers, GPS, and broadcast television—as well as “reach” applications—where space technologies helps companies across various industries generate revenue (e.g., Uber relies on satellite signals and chips inside smartphone to connect drivers and rider and provide GPS-enabled directions).  In addition, the world seems to have entered into a new “space race” with governments and private companies increasing spending on scientific missions, satellite technology, and even commercial space tourism.
Sustainable Aviation/Electric Propulsion: Sustainability is increasingly at the forefront of aerospace concerns. The industry is experiencing a notable shift towards eco-friendly and fuel-efficient aircraft. This change is propelled by both consumer demand for greener travel options and stringent environmental regulations.  This is driving considerable investment in electric propulsion technology.

Digital Transformation: Big data analytics, IoT, and AI are transforming maintenance, operations, and passenger experience.

Industry 4.0 Technologies: The revolutionary manufacturing technologies that comprise Industry 4.0 have wide applicability to the aerospace sector.

Possible Subsector Headwinds:
Possible Subsector Headwinds: 

Regulatory Challenges: Stringent regulatory requirements can act as a restraint on aerospace market supply. The aerospace industry is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and airspace management regulations. Compliance with these regulations often necessitates substantial investments, leading to increased costs for aerospace manufacturers and operators, impacting their profit margins. Moreover, the complex and evolving nature of these regulations can introduce uncertainty and complexity into business planning, making it challenging to navigate the market effectively.
Geopolitical Uncertainty and Protectionism: As part of the increasing trend toward protectionism and industrial policy, we are witnessing an alarming increase in trade disputes, sanctions, and diplomatic conflicts.  Trade disputes and protectionist policies can disrupt the global supply chain, impact international collaborations, and alter commercial and defense procurement decisions. 

Supply Chain Disruptions: Other factors beyond protectionist trade policies can disrupt the global aerospace supply chain, including natural disasters, regional conflicts, raw material shortages, and talent gaps, leading to increased time and production costs.  Airbus recently had to lower its revenue projections and supply chain issues were listed as the primary cause.
Safety Concerns: Aircraft and spacecraft rely on increasingly complicated technologies which have low tolerance for errors, leading to very public failures when there are significant safety failures.  Aerospace companies are also highly dependent upon a small number of suppliers whose performance is equally critical.  As Boeing has demonstrated, such “self-inflicted wounds” can lead to costly remedies, such as the grounding of the 737 Max  can cause significant erosion in consumer trust and unwanted regulatory scrutiny.   	

Higher for Longer/Economic Uncertainty:  The aerospace industry is exposed to higher interest rates, which impacts both company and customer financing, and economic uncertainty, which can lead to delays in orders for new aircraft.
Environmental Concerns: As noted above, the aerospace industry is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the economy.   Rising concerns about climate change and emissions from air travel have led to increasing pressure on the aerospace industry to develop more sustainable technologies, which can be costly and time-consuming.
Automotive Sector	
The global automotive industry was valued at $3.6 trillion in 2023 and is expected to reach $6.9 trillion by 2033. This growth is expected to be driven by increasing investments in public transportation infrastructure and changing consumer preferences, including ongoing growth in the EV market. Despite overall positive trends, 2023 was difficult particularly for U.S. automakers, with challenges including declining growth rates in EV sales, widespread strikes in U.S. factories, supply chain disruptions and rising material costs.  Despite these problems, the industry proved to be remarkably resilient with global car and commercial vehicle sales topping 90 million in 2023, reflecting a double-digit growth rate.  Having weathered the pandemic, labor unrest, fickle consumer demand, and supply chain disruptions, the sector is looking toward better times ahead.
A critical component of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), the global automotive industry is clearly in the midst of a significant transformation, with significant advancements in electrification, connectivity, and sustainability driving innovation worldwide. 	KPMG notes the following signs of change:

How cars work. The shift to electric power trains leaves traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) automakers furiously pursuing electric vehicle (EV) strategies—and facing new competitors.

How cars are built. The shift to EVs requires new ways of building cars—with completely different components and technologies. 

How cars are used. New ownership and usage models like ride hailing, ride sharing, and subscriptions continue to gain traction, with vehicles used on an “as-a-service” basis.

How cars are sold. Consumers have been shopping for cars online for years. Now they want to complete all their other vehicle-related transactions online, too.
How the industry is regulated. Policy and regulatory changes are critical to EV transition. Countries and states have set deadlines for ending ICE vehicle sales.
Electric Vehicles—Slowdown Not Stall: There has been significant hype in the market about the upcoming transition from the internal combustion engine, with its high greenhouse gas emissions, to more sustainable electric power trains. Like so many other technological transformations, the market overestimated how quickly this transition could occur (although they may still have correctly projected the endpoint, in large part due to global governmental commitments to addressing climate change). It is important to note, however, that though experiencing a slowdown in growth rates, EV sales are still projected to rise significantly in 2024.  In the U.S., EV sales in 2024 are expected to grow 16% year-over-year, compared to the 64% growth rate experienced in 2023, albeit starting from a relatively small base.  In China, year-over-year growth is projected to be 11.1% in 2024 compared to 36.5% in 2023.  In both markets, hybrid vehicles (both traditional and plug-in) have proven to be an
in 2023.  In both markets, hybrid vehicles (both traditional and plug-in) have proven to be an important transition product for consumers toward totally electric vehicles, in part because of concerns about the limited range of fully electric autos and the need to build out the public electric charging infrastructure. To attract the mass market, market leaders such as Tesla have been aggressively lowering prices.  This in turn has led the large traditional players like GM, VW, Toyota and Ford, to adjust their strategies, with some lowering prices and others delaying new models. This has pushed out the point at which EV sales are turning profit positive for U.S. automakers, although some analysts believe we have crossed this line just recently.
China’s Continued EV Dominance: In the global EV market, China remains the most important player and global influencer, contributing 60% to worldwide EV sales.  Its tightly controlled supply chain, relentless innovation, significant government subsidies, and growing global market presence are only solidifying its leadership position.  By 2025, China is expected to capture 12% of the European EV market, fueled by competitive pricing, cutting-edge battery technology, and the growing popularity of Chinese electric car brands in the U.K. and other European and Asian markets.  Notably, in 4Q23, BYD passed Tesla as the world’s largest electric-only car manufacturer, only for Tesla to retake the crown in 1Q24. Unlike Tesla, however, BYD also produces a significant number of Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid vehicles which have seen robust sales.
Redefining Luxury: Luxury automotive trends are also undergoing a paradigm shift, with traditional players redefining the “ultra-luxury segment” and non-luxury automakers strategically positioning top-end models as luxury vehicles.  Over the past few years, SUVs have emerged as the luxury car of choice for the mega-rich, influencing such brands as Aston Martin and Lamborghini.  EVs are also increasingly part of the luxury segment, expected to account for 15-17% of luxury sales by 2024.  With its growing affluent population, China is emerging as a significant market force in this segment as well.
5G—The Connected Car: 5G technology has wide applicability to the automotive industry, with major players like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, GM, Ford, Skoda, and Geely adopting it in their smart factories to improve automation, safety, and efficiency. Incorporating 5G will also enhance in-car experiences with faster data transmission, low-latency communication, and improved navigation and infotainment systems. The automotive sector is expected to see a 30-35% annual growth rate in 5G adoption over the next few years. 5G will also facilitate “the connected car” linking our vehicles to our connected homes, workplaces, energy networks, cell phones, and more.
Generative AI: Shaping the Future of Cars: Generative AI is already at work in the automotive sector, impacting vehicle design, navigation, predictive maintenance, voice assistants, manufacturing, supply chains, and quality control. It also will enhance the safety, efficiency, and personalization of in-car interactions. Major automotive companies are increasingly adopting this technology—for example, Toyota and BMW for vehicle design, Tesla in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), Continental in digital cockpits, and Mercedes Benz in Personal Voice Assistants.
Autonomous Vehicles—Will Their Time Ever Come? Despite Elon Musk’s predictions to the contrary, the market for autonomous vehicles has yet to take off, hampered by cost, infrastructure gaps, consumer unease and regulatory/ethical questions. At some point, however, there will be a compelling case for AV vehicles, most notably on safety grounds, once the AI becomes sufficiently advanced and cost points more accessible.  Note that 90% of road accidents are due to human errors, according to the Victoria Transport Policy Institute.  AV AI can also keep vehicle hardware healthier for longer periods by driving vehicles more safely and strategically. The ADAS and the autonomous driving market are expected to reach a threshold of $55 to $80 billion by 2030, as predicted by a report by .

Possible Subsector Tailwinds:

Hybrids as Bridge to Fully Electric:  Sales of HEVs and PHEVs have been surprisingly robust, while fully electric BEV’s have in general underperformed estimates.  Drivers for hybrid sales include customer anxiety about the limited range of BEV’s and the lack of charging infrastructure in most communities. This suggests that hybrid vehicles may play an important bridge function to BEVs while battery technology continues to  and infrastructure is built out. This trend creates advantages for manufacturers with robust hybrid offerings (including Toyota, Hyundai, BYD, Honda, and Ford) while penalizing those who are lagging (most notably GM).  

Growth in Auto Leasing Market: The trend away from the ownership model driven by high vehicle costs is leading to robust growth rates in the auto leasing market.  Some estimates project the leasing market to reach $401.7 billion by 2032, a CAGR of an impressive 11.1% from 2024-2032.
Long-Term Promise of Autonomous Vehicles: As mentioned above, the market for  vehicles has faced a lot of short-term challenges, including accident incidents, consumer unease, and lack of infrastructure.  In the long-term, however, the sector’s outlook is bright. The ADAS and the autonomous driving market are expected to reach a threshold of $55 to $80 billion by 2030, as predicted by a report by
Government/Private Infrastructure Put: The automotive sector will benefit from increased government/private spending on the development of infrastructure for EVs, such as charging stations.  Significant investments (approximately $7.5 billion) in this area was included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, for example.  The Infrastructure Reduction Act (IRA) also included significant incentives for the purchase of EVs, including up to $7,500 per vehicle for new EVs and up to $4,000 for purchase of used EVs.  Credits for commercial electric vehicle ranged from $7,500 for smaller vehicles to $40,000 for heavier vehicles.  The IRA also included tax credits for home and commercial chargers, incentives for EV manufacturing in the U.S., and spending on public transit and infrastructure.
Improvements in Battery Technology: The future of battery technology looks promising, with multiple approaches being used to improve performance, safety, and sustainability.  However, it will take time for these new technologies to become commercially viable at scale.  Many analysts believe that solid state batteries will be the next big evolution in battery tech, offering higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety.  Companies like BMW, Toyota and others are already working on solid-state batteries for EVS, with potential commercialization in the late 2020s or early 2030s. 

Demand Growth in Emerging Markets: As global economies recover from recent downturns and as middle-class populations grow in emerging markets, demand for automobiles is on the rise.
Advances in Manufacturing and Supply Chain Logistics: Improvements in manufacturing processes, such as increased automation and implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies, are increasing efficiency and reducing costs.  Better supply chain management and increased use of data analytics are also helping to streamline operations. 

Shared Mobility Trends: Business models, including car-sharing and ride-hailing, are creating both opportunities and challenges for the automotive industry.  While the trend could potentially reduce overall the number of cars needed, it will also lead to a steady demand for new, durable, and technologically advanced cars.  

Possible Subsector Headwinds:
Possible Subsector Headwinds: 	

Unprofitable EV Lines: With the exception of Tesla and , most major manufacturers have been losing money on their EV lines, hampering performance and reducing free cash flow.  U.S. automakers, on average, lose about $6,000 on every $50,000 EV sold. This is due to high production costs, particularly for batteries, and the substantial  required for new factories and technology development.  Ford, for example, reported losing $132,000 per EV sold in Q1 2024 and $40,525 per EV in 2023. The industry expects such losses to turn around over time, however, as high costs are amortized over ever larger sales volumes.  GM, for example, projects that its EV vertical will be cash positive by the second half of 2024.
Price Wars Lowering EV Margins: Aggressive pricing for EVs from Tesla as well as the leading Chinese automakers have caused the traditional car companies to respond in kind, lowering overall profit margins.  Tesla initiated the price war, reducing prices on all of its models, including the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X.  Ford responded by cutting prices on its Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models.  Other manufacturers including Hyundai, Kia, and Audi followed offering incentives or rebates on their EV models.  Perhaps most importantly, over 40 Chinese automakers have reduced prices on both their electric and gas models.
Trade Protectionism: The recent price wars have intensified concerns about unfair Chinese competition and recently led to the EU tariffs on Chinese EVs, on top of existing US trade barriers. Such trade tensions between countries can limit access to markets and impact the cost and accessibility of automotive components and finished vehicles, affecting prices to consumers and profitability for automakers.      

Holding Onto Cars for Longer—Bad For Automakers but Good for Parts Retailers: In response to higher vehicle prices and financing costs, consumers are holding onto their current cars for longer periods.  The average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads reached a record 12.6 years in 2024.  This trend depresses demand for automakers.  Their woes, however, are good news for auto parts manufacturers and sellers.  Spherical Insights projects that the overall auto parts market to reach $1.1 billion by 2030, a CAGR of 6.8% from 2023 to 2030.
Rising Unionization: There are signs of increasing unionization efforts in the auto sector, particularly in the Southern United States, which has been resistant historically to unions. The UAW is targeting workers at 13 car makers, including foreign companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volvo.  The union is also targeting American EV makers Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid.  To the extent that these efforts are successful, there could be increases in labor unrest, production disruptions, and higher overall production costs.  

Regulatory Challenges: Ongoing changes in regulatory requirements add cost and uncertainty. Increasing environmental regulations (e.g., the recent U.S. tightening of fuel mileage standards) are necessitating significant investments in cleaner technologies, the transition away from internal combustion vehicles to EVs, and higher compliance costs.
Supply Chain Disruptions: The automotive industry relies on a complex global supply chain for materials, electronic components, and auto parts. As was demonstrated in 2023, disruptions can result in slowdowns in manufacturing and failure to meet consumer demand.  Supply disruptions can be caused by numerous factors, including semiconductor shortages, logistics and shipping delays (e.g., port congestion, blockage of Suez Canal), natural disasters, labor shortages, trade barriers, and shortages/price increases in raw materials.

Cap Ex Requirements: The drive to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies and the transition toward EVs and potentially autonomous vehicles is requiring significant capital expenditures by the automotive sector, including the need to completely retool auto plants.  

Changing Consumer Preferences on Ownership vs. Access: Emerging trends such as ride-sharing, car-sharing, and a general shift away from ownership to access can reduce the demand for new vehicles.
New Competition: Intense competition from both traditional automakers, often government subsidized, and new entrants, particularly in EVs (e.g., Tesla, Rivian), adds pressure on established companies to innovate and stay relevant.
Railroads, Construction Machinery and Equipment, and Robotics & Automation
Industry 4.0 (the fourth industrial revolution) is characterized by the integration of digital technologies into manufacturing and industrial processes. In addition to healthcare and pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, consumer electronics, energy and utilities, and aerospace and defense (discussed above or in other macro theses), among the industries most poised to take advantage of Industry 4.0 are railroads, construction machinery and equipment makers, and leaders in robotics and automation.  These three sectors are also likely to be the direct beneficiaries of many infrastructure projects, further boosting their future prospects.  Finally, these three sectors will benefit from significant public and private investment to address global climate change (rail transportation is more energy efficient than car or plane transportation). SCP’s investment thesis includes identifying the companies that can best capitalize upon the significant trends toward Industry 4.0, infrastructure
companies that can best capitalize upon the significant trends toward Industry 4.0, infrastructure renewal, and energy sustainability as well as those most likely to enter into productive public-private partnerships to make such transformations feasible.
Railroads—More Relevant than Ever: The railroad sector in North America (primarily the United States, Canada, and Mexico) remains a vital part of the continent’s transportation network, delivering significant economic, environmental, and societal benefits. With strategic investments, innovative technological integration, and supportive regulatory and fiscal policies, SCP believes the sector can continue to serve as a backbone for freight and passenger transportation, driving sustainable development and economic resilience. Reflecting this optimism, the North America rail infrastructure market, approximately $114.3 billion in 2021, is projected to grow to $162.7 billion by 2029, reflecting a CAGR of 4.52% during the period (Fortune Business Insights).
The railroad sector can be divided into two broad categories—freight railroads and passenger railroads.  Within the freight subsector, railroads are divided into Class I, II, or III, depending on the breadth of their systems.  Class I railroads are the largest freight railroads in North America, including five in the U.S. (Union Pacific, BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern, and Kansas City Southern [now part of Canadian Pacific]) and two in Canada (Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway).  Class I railroads account for a large majority of freight rail mileage and revenue. Class II and III railroads, also known as regional and short-line railroads, are smaller and serve as feeders to the Class I network. They provide critical local and regional service, connecting smaller communities and industries to the larger national and international markets.
The passenger railroad subsector in North America is highly concentrated. In the U.S., Amtrak is the primary provider of intercity passenger rail service, operating more than 21,000 route miles in 46 states.  In Canada, VIA Rail offers similar intercity travel across various provinces.  Supplementing these two national players are smaller commuter rail services serving various metropolitan areas (e.g., Metra in Chicago, Caltrain in SF, and GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area).  Such commuter rail services not only facilitate daily commutes but also reduce highway congestion and related greenhouse gas emissions.  	

Possible Subsector Tailwinds:

Breadth of Network: North America enjoys one of the largest and most extensive rail networks in the world, with the U.S. alone having over 140,000 route miles of track.  Such breadth is crucial for bulk transportation of all types.
Intermodal Transportation: Growth in intermodal transportation, where goods are shipped using multiple modes (rail, truck, ship), has been significant. Railroads play a key role in this logistics chain, providing efficient solutions for moving containers from ports to inland destinations. 

Advancements in Technology:  Modern railroads are investing heavily in Industry 4.0 technologies, including predictive maintenance, automated inspection systems, and advanced data analytics to enhance safety and efficiency. A great example of this is Positive Train Control, an advanced system designed to automatically stop a train before certain accidents can occur.
Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR): PSR is a railroad management strategy that has been proven to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and reduce costs by focusing on point-to-point freight movements on simplified routing networks.  It has been adopted by most Class I North American railroad, including Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, Union Pacific, CSX and Kansas City Southers.  BNSF is the only major holdout.  

Demand for Sustainability/EVs: As noted, railroads are inherently more fuel-efficient than trucks for long-haul freight, making them a crucial component in national plans to meet aggressive sustainability targets. In addition, far sighted rail companies are investing in cleaner technologies, such as low-emission locomotives and alternative fuels like natural gas and biofuels.
Public Private Partnerships: Collaboration between the government and private sectors will be essential to fund necessary infrastructure upgrades and expansions.  Programs like the U.S. federal grant initiatives for rail improvements and Canada’s National Trade Corridors Fund are examples of such partnerships. 

Cross Border Integration: During a time of trade wars and nationalism, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA, is a good counter study of how free trade can lift all boats. The rail networks are a critical component of this success, being highly integrated and sophisticated in facilitating seamless cross-border trade.	

Urban and High Speed Rail: There is growing interest in developing high-speed rail corridors linking the heavily travelled Northeast Corridor in the U.S. and connecting major cities in Canada.  Such services would provide a more sustainable alternative to auto or air travel. 	


 Possible Subsector Headwinds:
Possible Subsector Headwinds:

Labor Strife: The sector is highly unionized which can lead to challenging labor negotiations and potential disruptions from strikes.  Ensuring a skilled and motivated workforce while controlling labor costs is a constant balancing act.  

Safety Concerns: Despite considerable advancements in safety technologies, rail accidents can still occur, often with severe consequences.  Such incidents can also cause significant reputational harm. 

Shift from Goods to Services: Reversing the trend of the pandemic, in recent years growth in the consumption of services has outpaced consumption of goods.  This can lead to less need for ground transportation.  

Aging Infrastructure: Significant parts of the rail infrastructure have had long years of service, requiring continuing investment and upgrades.  Maintaining and modernizing this infrastructure will be both a financial and logistical challenge.
Competition with Other Modes: Railroads face intense competition from the trucking and aviation industries, particularly for time-sensitive and high-value goods.  Balancing service quality with operational costs is a constant challenge.

Regulatory Environment: While deregulation in the 1980s has provided many benefits, railroads still must navigate a complex web of federal, state, and local regulations, which can impact operations and cost. Stricter environmental regulations, for example, might push the sector to adopt cleaner technologies faster, such as electrification of rail lines and the use of battery-powered or hydrogen-fueled locomotives, but such transformations will come with a significant price tag.
Construction Machinery and Equipment: Similar to the railroad sector, the Construction Machinery and Equipment sector will benefit from the macro trends of Industry 4.0 and infrastructure renewal. The sector will also be under government pressure to invest in more energy efficient operations and end products (including such technologies as next-generation batteries, electric motors, and power management systems). For these reasons, SCP remains bullish on this sector. 

The market for construction machinery and equipment in the U.S. in 2021 was valued at $22.5 billion and is expected to reach $32.7 billion by 2027, a CAGR of 6.34%.
