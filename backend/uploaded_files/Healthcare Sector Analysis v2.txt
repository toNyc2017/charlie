II.  Macroeconomic Background:

A.  Health Care and the Economy:
The health care sector  has  a complicated and multifaceted  relationship  with the overall macroeconomic health  of  the  economy.    On  the  one  hand,  the  health  care  system  plays  an  important  role  in  overall population  health,  contributing  positively  to  standards  of  living  and  productivity.  From  this  lens, consumption of health care products and services is a positive contributor to overall GDP.  On the other hand, the recent history of health care in the U.S. has seen tremendous advances in medical technology, accompanied,  however,  by  alarming  increases  in  the  costs  of  care.    This  continued  trend  of  health  care inflation outpacing economic growth has led to concerns about health care spending by corporations and governments  crowding  out  many  other  critical  expenditures  (e.g.,  infrastructure,  R&D).    Importantly, health care spending is stable across bull and bear markets and certain HC subsectors may be marginally countercyclical.
stable across bull and bear markets and certain HC subsectors may be marginally countercyclical.  This increases the sector’s attractiveness for investment as it should act as performance and volatility mitigator when included as part of a multi-sector fund (Beta below 1.0).
Early 20th Century to Mid-20th Century (US)

Pre-1950s: US health care costs were relatively low as a percentage of GDP and stable.  Medical

technology  was  less  advanced,  and  most  people  paid  for  health  care  services  out-of-pocket.

President Truman becomes first leader to push for national health insurance.  Although Truman's

ambitious  plans  did  not  materialize  during  his  presidency,  his  efforts  laid  the  groundwork  for

future discussions and developments in healthcare policy. His advocacy highlighted the need for

expanded  healthcare  access  and  set  the  stage  for  later  reforms,  including  the  establishment  of

Medicare and Medicaid.

Post  World-War  II:  The  introduction  of  employer-sponsored  insurance  plans,  an  unplanned

outcome  of  the  GI  Act,  led  to  more  people  having  access  to  medical  services.    This  increased

demand, coupled with advances in medical technology, began to drive up health care costs.

1960s to 1980s





1960s: The establishment of Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. in 1965 provided critically needed health coverage to elderly and low-income Americans, respectively.  This greatly increased access to health care services and contributed to rising costs. 1970s-1980s: Health care costs continued to rise sharply due to inflation, increased utilization of medical services, and advancements in medical technology.  Economists began signaling a warning call about health care spending outpacing general economic growth.

Late 20th Century
Late 20th Century



1980s-1990s:  The drive to control costs led to the more wide-spread creation of health maintenance organizations  (HMOs)  and  managed  care  systems,  which  focused  on  preventive  care  and  cost- effective  treatment  options.    Providers  also  began  to  reorganize,  forming  larger  and  larger economic units such as Integrated Delivery Systems, in part as an attempt to improve the efficiency of health care delivery and also as a reaction to the market pressure exerted by the Payors/HMOs. Despite  these  efforts,  health  care  costs  continued  to  rise,  driven  by  factors  such  as  the  aging population and new expensive medical treatments.

21st Century to Present
21st Century to Present







2000s: Health care costs continued to increase,  usually  outpacing general inflation.   Key  drivers include  chronic  disease  prevalence,  obesity  rates,  administrative  costs,  and  technological advancements. 2010s: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was introduced in 2010, aiming to expand coverage, control costs, and improve the overall health care system.  While the ACA helped reduce the number of uninsured, it did not significantly bend the cost curve downward for health inflation. 2020s: The COVID-19 pandemic led to surges in spending on emergency responses, vaccination campaigns,  and  ongoing  treatment  for  those  infected.  Telehealth  expanded  rapidly  as  an alternative  to  in-person  visits.  Medtech/biotech  enters  into  a  “golden  age”  that  promises increasingly effective treatments, albeit at high price tags.  Health care spending as percentage of GDP and the federal budget reaches new highs.
Questionable Sustainability of Health Care Inflation After decades of high health care inflation, health care expenditures in the U.S. have reached 17.8% of GDP in 2023, roughly double the rate of other OECD countries.  The National Health, Education, and Welfare Administration (NHE) projects that the health spending share of GDP will increase to 19.6% in 2031, due to average health care inflation of 5.4% from 2022–2031 compared to the average GDP growth of 4.6%.  In other words, in just seven years, roughly $1 out of every $5 spent in the nation will go for health care.

Health care expenditures are also one of the largest drivers of the U.S. debt crisis.  In fiscal year 2023, the Kaiser  Family  Foundation reported  that  federal  spending  on  domestic  and  global  health  programs  and services made up 29% of net federal outlays, or $1.9 trillion out of $6.4 trillion. This includes:

Medicare: 13%

Medicaid and CHIP: 10%

Other domestic health spending: 4%
Medicare: 13%

Medicaid and CHIP: 10%

Other domestic health spending: 4%

Hospital and medical care for veterans: 2%

Global health: 0.1%

Consistent with the theme, “It’s all about entitlements, stupid,” roughly 80% of these expenditures are mandatory absent changes in the law.  Despite this, there is little to no political activity advocating for health care entitlement reform.  Regulators and lawmakers have instead focused on reducing costs by limiting the profits of Big Pharma and the largest payors (such as UNH), which while potentially offering short-term savings also risks destabilizing the sector.
Golden Age of Health Care Technology Breakthroughs in cell and gene therapies (including CRISPR); new technologies such as mRNA and GLP- 1; and the promise for AI to improve health care data analysis, diagnostics, and predictive analytics and speed up drug development are leading the way in what many believe will be a golden age for health care technology (biotech/medtech)1.

Cell and Gene Therapy Cell  and  gene  therapy  hold  transformative  promise  due  to  their  potential  to  treat  chronic  or  genetic conditions that were previously considered untreatable. Cell therapy involves introducing living cells into a patient to replace or repair damaged tissue, treat a disease, or boost the immune system.2 Gene therapy

1 Other promising technologies include:

Immuno-oncology Agents: These drugs help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. New types of immuno-

oncology treatments, such as bispecific antibodies and cancer vaccines, are under development.
oncology treatments, such as bispecific antibodies and cancer vaccines, are under development.

Targeted Protein Degradation: This category includes drugs designed to eliminate disease-causing proteins in the body. Protac

molecules (proteolysis targeting chimeras) are a prime example, which can target specific proteins for degradation by the cell's

natural waste disposal system.

Senolytics: These are drugs that selectively induce death of senescent cells—cells that have stopped dividing and contribute to

aging and age-related diseases. Senolytics have the potential to treat a variety of age-associated conditions.

Microbiome Modulators: These drugs aim to treat diseases by altering the composition of the microbiome. They may either

involve the use of living microorganisms (probiotics), non-viable microorganisms or their components (postbiotics), or substances

that selectively stimulate beneficial microbes (prebiotics).
that selectively stimulate beneficial microbes (prebiotics).

(RNAi Therapeutics: RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics involve silencing specific genes that are implicated in a disease. They

can prevent the production of harmful proteins before they are even made.

Antisense Oligonucleotides: Similar to RNAi, antisense drugs bind to mRNA and inhibit the production of disease-related

proteins by targeting their genetic blueprint.

BCMA-Targeted Therapies: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein that is expressed on the surface of plasma cells.

Targeting BCMA has shown promise in treating multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer of plasma cells.

2 Types of Cell Therapy

1.

Stem Cell Therapy:

Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs): Commonly used in bone marrow transplants to treat blood-related diseases like

leukemia and lymphoma.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs): Used for their ability to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and fat cells, making them
useful in regenerative medicine for conditions such as osteoarthritis and traumatic injuries.



Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs): These have the potential to become any cell type in the body, offering possibilities for treating a wide range of diseases.

2.

Immune Cell Therapy:

CAR-T Cell Therapy: T cells are genetically engineered to better recognize and attack cancer cells. This has shown

significant success in treating certain blood cancers.

Dendritic Cell Therapy: Dendritic cells are modified to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells or infectious

agents. 3.  Other Cell Types:

Chondrocytes: Used in the treatment of cartilage defects and injuries.

involves  modifying  or  replacing  defective  genes  within  a  patient’s  cells.    Cell  and  gene  therapy  hold significant promise in such areas as cancer treatment, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, and medicine. personalized
Messenger RNA Technology (mRNA) mRNA technology is a groundbreaking method for creating vaccines and therapeutics. It works by using synthetic mRNA, which is a molecule that tells cells how to make proteins.  The mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles to facilitate its entry into  human cells and these nanoparticles are what make up the vaccine or therapeutic agent. The biggest success to date for mRNA technology has been its use to develop the  COVID-19  vaccines  (both  Pfizer-BioNTech’s  and  Moderna’s).  Advantages  include  the  speed  of development, efficacy, the ability to quickly update vaccines in response to viral mutations, and safety (e.g., they  are  non-integrating,  meaning  they  don’t  enter  the  cell’s  DNA).    mRNA  technology  has  proven therapeutic  efficacy  in  such areas  as  infectious  disease,  immunotherapy,  genetic  disorders,  regenerative medicine, and cancer.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) Agonists GLP-1 Agonists are a class of type 2 diabetes drugs that not only improve blood sugar control but also lead to significant weight loss.3  Although weight loss can vary depending on which GLP-1 drug you use and your  dose,  all  GLP-1  drugs  can  lead  to  weight  loss  of  about  10.5-15.8  pounds  when  using  liraglutide (Source: Mayo).4  Patients using semaglutide and making lifestyle changes lost about 33.7 pounds.  These drugs mimic the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1.  When blood sugar leves start to rise after someone eats, these drugs stimulate the body to produce more insulin, helping to lower blood sugar levels.  GLP-1s also  help curb hunger  and slow  the  movement  of  food from the stomach into  the small intesting.  In part due to the weight loss, these drugs also have been found to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke,  and  kidney  disease  and  improve  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol  levels.
disease, stroke,  and  kidney  disease  and  improve  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol  levels.    GLP-1s  are  already blockbuster drugs and have been to reach sales of $100 billion by 2030 (JP Morgan Research).
Artificial Intelligence Applications AI already has a significant history of being applied to health care, beginning with the field of diagnostics. The success there, even with rudimentary AI systems, suggests that AI will have numerous applications to health care moving forward. An incomplete list follows:



Improved  Diagnostics:  AI  algorithms  can  assist  in  diagnosing  diseases  by  interpreting  medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy.  This can lead to earlier detection of medical conditions.



Pancreatic Islet Cells: Used in diabetes treatment to restore normal insulin production. 3 A second class of drugs with similar promise is the sodium glucose contransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. 4 Diabetes drugs in the GLP-1 agonists class are generally taken by a shot (injection) given daily or weekly and include:

Exenatide extended release (Bydureon bcise) (weekly)

Exenatide (Byetta) (twice daily)

Dulaglutide (Trulicity) (weekly)

Personalized Medicine: AI can analyze a patient’s genetic information, lifestyle and environment

to tailor treatment plans specific to the individual.

Predictive Analytics: By analyzing the vast amount of data stored in electronic health records and

other  sources,  AI  can  identify  trends  and  predict  outbreaks,  patient  outcomes,  and  disease

progression, allowing for earlier and more precise interventions.

Drug Discovery and Development: AI can accelerate the process of drug discovery by predicting

how  different  drugs  will  interact  with  target  populations,  assisting  with  the  identification  of
promising drug candidates, and analyzing vast amounts of clinical data more rapidly than could

be done before.

Surgical Assistance: AI tools can provide surgeons with real-time insights, superior monitoring,

and enhanced visualizations, potentially reducing human error.

Virtual Health Assistants: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide patients with

medical information, remind them to take medications, or monitor chronic conditions.

Wearable Technology: In health care’s version of moving to the edge, wearable devices such as

smart watches, fitness trackers, and health patches enable continuous monitoring, real-time data

analysis, and proactive health management.  This has applications such as remote monitoring of

chronic conditions and real-time alerts such as when a patient suffers a stroke.

Telehealth and Remote Monitoring: AI can enhance telehealth services by providing diagnostic
Telehealth and Remote Monitoring: AI can enhance telehealth services by providing diagnostic

support  during  virtual  consultations  and  continuously  monitoring  patient’s  health  remotely,

offering timely interventions.

Operational  Efficiency:  AI  can streamline  administrative  tasks  such  as  scheduling,  billing,  and

patient flow management.
To the extent that these new technologies offer the hope for long-term cures, they clearly will be the focus of  significant  investment.    Whether  their  success  will  increase  or  decrease  health  care  costs  as  a  whole, however, is debatable.  As discussed in a recent Time Magazine article, “As exciting as the possible new medications are, they also raise questions about affordability and accessibility. Innovative drug treatments involving gene therapy and CRISPR, for example, are designed to be one-time treatments that can mitigate the need for repeated and often lifelong medical care. But that means higher upfront costs, and it’s not clear whether insurers will cover such hefty price tags. As more therapies reach the market, however, they could change the reimbursement structure as insurers will likely feel increasing pressure to cover treatments that could be not just life-changing but also potentially curative—and save millions in long-term  health care costs.”
As in our Technology sector analysis, we believe that the rate of adoption for new healthcare technologies will follow the “S Curve”, also known as the diffusions of innovations theory.  The curve is typically shaped like  an  “S,”  with  slow  initial  growth  as  innovators  and  early  adopters  begin  to  experiment  with  the technology.  This is followed by a rapid acceleration as the technology gains momentum and is adopted by the  early  majority  and  eventually  late  majority.    Finally,  the  curve  tapers  off  as  the  technology  reaches saturation among the laggards.  Initially, the costs for these new treatments will be quite expensive, likely contributing  to  healthcare  inflation.    Over  the  long-term,  one  would  hope  that  new  treatments  would reduce overall costs by preventing any number of costly chronic conditions (e.g., healthy people need fewer health care services).  We can see this playing out, for example, with the recent class of weight loss
care services).  We can see this playing out, for example, with the recent class of weight loss drugs. Short-term costs are high and system savings will take years to play out.  Ultimately, bending the health care  curve  will  likely  require  significant  new  therapeutic  and  curative  treatments  across  the  “Big  4”: cardiovascular  disease,  insulin  resistance  (diabetes),  caner,  and  neurodegenerative  disease  (Alzheimers, Parkinsons).

III.  Subsector Investment Thesis:

SCP has extensive experience with the health care sector.  Consistent with the macroeconomic view above, SCP is focusing its investments in (1) companies which can commercialize promising new technologies (i.e., take advantage of the Golden Age for medtech/biotech), and (2) companies that can work in partnership with the federal government to finally bend the curve downward on health care inflation and bring health care costs onto a more sustainable path.  Consequently, SCP has focused its investments in three critical subsectors: Big Pharma, Payors and Providers, and Medtech/Biotech.

A.  Big Pharma:

"Big Pharma" refers to the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, which play a significant role in the

healthcare industry by conducting critical research and development (typically  up to 15% of revenues),
developing  new  drugs  that  demonstrate  clinical  efficacy,  and  then  bringing  these  drugs  to  market,

including navigating through the labyrinth of clinical trials.  Apart from developing their drugs pipeline

via internal R&D, these companies also frequently acquire biotech companies to bolster and complement

their product portfolio. Big Pharma’s product portfolios include a wide range of medicines, vaccines, and

biotechnology  products  that  cater  to  therapeutic  areas  including  oncology,  cardiology,  neurology,

immunology,  and  infectious  diseases.  They  also  operate  on  a  global  scale,  with  sales  and  operations

spanning numerous continents.

The pharmaceutical sector has continued to grow rapidly over the last two decades, with global revenues

reaching $1.48 trillion in 2022 (source Statista).  Big Pharma comprises a large portion of the sector, with
sales  in  2022  of  $949  billion  (approximately  65%  market  share).    In  that  same  year,  these  large

6

Stamos Capital Partners, L.P.

Sector Analysis—Healthcare

pharmaceutical companies made an impressive $112 billion in profits.  Given their considerable cash flow

and solid balance sheets, Big Pharma also play a critical role in the innovation ecosphere.  First, they invest heavily into their own R&D on emerging technologies.  Second, by acquiring smaller, often venture-backed

innovators, they provide an exit option for early investors while refreshing their product pipelines.  Finally,

they  enter  into  strategic  alliances  with  innovators,  including  venture-backed  firms,  large  technology

companies such as Google and Microsoft, and universities, leveraging the sales and distribution reach of

Big Pharma and providing a path to commercialization for promising technologies.5

Public and policymaker perception of Big Pharma is decidedly mixed.  On the one hand, they are rightfully

credited  with  bringing  to  market  cost-  and  life-saving  treatments.  On  the  other  hand,  their  success  in

generating large profit margins leads to accusations of inequitable pricing and sales practices, putting them

in the sights of regulators worldwide.  Similar to SCP’s thesis on the large oil majors and their critical role

in  energy  transformation,  however,  we  believe  that  Big  Pharma  is  a  vital  and  necessary  piece  of  the

equation for leveraging the promise of AI and gene and cell therapy. They have the resources to make such

innovations possible and the product management and marketing skills and the distribution network to

commercialize  these  innovations.

Our  investment  thesis,  therefore,  is  to  identify  the  leading
Our  investment  thesis,  therefore,  is  to  identify  the  leading

pharmaceutical  companies  worldwide  who  are  poised  to  and  have  the  wherewithal  to  make  such

investments, both through their own R&D as well as through acquisitions and alliances, and also effectively

monetize them through their marketing efforts and distribution network.  Given the increasingly high costs

of prescription medicine and the high price tags for new cell and gene therapies, SCP also believes that Big

Pharma must work closely with governments around the world to ensure affordable access to their life

saving products and help to bend the curve  on  health  care inflation.  Companies that can balance  such

public/private partnerships (e.g., demonstrate regulatory expertise and finesse) while still maintaining top- tier performance will command a premium in the capital markets.

1.  Possible Subsector Tailwinds:

a.  Increasing Demand Due to Favorable Demographics: As the global population continues to grow and age, there will be increasing demand for healthcare services, including pharmaceuticals.  Such increasing demand should translate into revenue growth.

b.  Technological  Advancements/Strong  Pipeline:  As  discussed,  advancements  such  as  AI  and genomics  are  driving  considerable  innovation  in  the  sector.    Companies  that  succeed  in commercializing  such  technologies  will  have  strong  pipelines  of  new  products,  operate  more efficiently, and earn market premiums.
c.  GLP-1 Blockbusters: As noted, there is an impressive demand for these new anti-obesity/type 2 diabetes drugs and to date they have been able to attract premium pricing.  Companies with strong GLP-1 product pipelines will clearly be among the winners in the next few years.  The impact of these drugs is so broad that they have implications downstream for payors who must struggle with the additional short-term costs of these drugs, for medtech companies who will sell fewer weight- related devices (e.g., CPAP, insulin monitors), and even for food companies who will need to retool their offerings for a healthier customer base.

d.  Emerging Market Demand: To the extent that emerging markets are successful in growing their middle  classes  and  improving  access  to  healthcare  services  population-wide,  pharmaceutical companies will have new growth opportunities and the ability to diversify their revenue streams.
e.  M&A/Collaboration Opportunities: Big Pharma in general has strong balance sheets and

sufficient dry powder that can be utilized to buy out promising but smaller and unprofitable biotech companies at discounted prices as the latter are struggling due to higher for longer rate environment and a tough funding environment.

f.  Specialty  Drugs:  A  number  of  large  pharmaceutical  companies  are  increasingly  focusing  on specialty  drugs—high-cost  medications  used  to  treat  complex  and  rare  diseases.  Such  drugs typically have higher pricing potential and profitability.
g.  Attractive Investment Characteristics:   Big  Pharma  companies  typically  enjoy  strong  balance sheets,  stable  cash  flows/earnings,  low  cyclicality,  strong  dividends  (level  and  growth),  and attractive valuations (due in part to election-related risks and patent cliffs).  Consequently, these companies  are  attractive  investments  and  provide  ballast  in  client  portfolios,  especially  given today’s  inflated  valuations,  higher-for-longer  rate  environment,  and  elevated  geopolitical  risk regime.

2.  Sector Headwinds
2.  Sector Headwinds

a.  Potential Regulation and Legislation:  Governments across the globe are focused on controlling the cost of prescription medicine and are highly likely to implement new regulations and health care  reforms  that  limit  the  pricing  flexibility  of  the  sector.    The  most  recent  U.S.  example  is  the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which for the first time empowers Medicare to negotiate prices for certain  high-cost  prescription  drugs  directly  with  pharmaceutical  companies.  This  negotiation process will begin with a selected list of drugs, expanding over time to include more medications. Drug manufacturers are also required to pay rebates to Medicare if they increase the prices of their medications faster than the rate of inflation. Finally, the act includes a specific provision to cap the monthly cost of insulin at $35 for Medicare beneficiaries. Note that implementation of the IRA has

8

been delayed due to the complexity of price negotiations and the need to build need administrative systems.

b.  Impending Patent Cliff: All drug companies bear the risk of losing patent protection (20 years) or losing  exclusivity  (usually  5  years)  for  their  products  which  allows  competition  from  generic alternatives  and  reduces  profitability.  Patent  expirations  over  2023-2030  could  leave  more  than $350bn of large-pharma annual sales exposed to generics, with US drugmakers more at risk than their EU counterparts.  Consensus analysis sees ~$140bn in potential sales erosion over this period for the peer group.
c.  Drug  Development  Costs:  The  costs  of  bringing  new  drugs  to  market  are  increasing  due  to increasingly stringent regulations, the requirement for larger and more complex clinical trials, and increasingly high R&D costs as companies pursue new technologies.  Median cost of launching a new  drug  is  approximately  $1bn,  with  no  guarantees  that  initial  sunk  costs  will  be  recovered should the product fail during approval process.

d.  Intense Competition: Big Pharma faces competitive pressure from both their peers as well as new entrants,  including  venture-backed  biotech  companies  and  startups.    This  creates  the  need  to constantly innovate and differentiate their products.
e.  Poor Public Perception:  The pharmaceutical company has been intensively scrutinized for their pricing  methodologies,  their  marketing  practices,  excessive  profit  taking,  and  the  opioid  crisis. Such coverage has led to a decline in public trust which can impact the industry’s ability to attract capital, partners, and customers.

B.  Payors and Providers: Although  payors  and  providers  typically  sit  across  from  each  other  at  the  negotiating  table6,  they  both  are essential stakeholders in the drive for cost containment and quality improvement.  Both sides will play a critical

role moving forward and increasingly collaboration between the two subsectors will be required to move the needle on bending the health care inflation curve.  Successful payors and providers will need to manage the convergence  of  new  technology,  regulatory  changes,  and  cost  containment  demands.    Interestingly,  many leading payors have started vertically integrating with providers to better control cost ratios (e.g., primary care clinics, telemedicine, urgent care, etc.) Our investment thesis, therefore, is to identify the leading payors and

providers that can strategically manage this convergence.
More specifically, SCP is seeking to invest in companies that can successfully manage the application of the new treatment technologies (e.g., gene and cell therapy, mRNA, etc.) as well as leverage AI, including enhanced data analytics, data driven decision making, telehealth and remote monitoring/wearables, automated claims adjustment, robotic automated tasks, etc.  Companies that can leverage blockchain technology to create secure and seamless data transfer of confidential records will also have an edge up. As with Big Pharma, large payors 7 and  providers  will  also  need  to  demonstrate  considerable  regulatory  agility  as  the  state  and  federal governments pursue health care reform. Finally, players who are able to lead efforts at cost containment will receive  market  premiums,  including  such  capitalizing  on  recent  trends  such  as  personalized  medicine,  the application of behavioral economics to consumer behavior, increased emphasis on preventive and holistic
of behavioral economics to consumer behavior, increased emphasis on preventive and holistic care, increased focus on health equity and social determinants, and new payment models (e.g., value-based care, bundled payments or accountable care organizations).
1.  Possible Subsector Tailwinds:

a.  Technological Advancements: innovations in healthcare technologies, such as the application of AI, cell and gene therapies, remote monitoring and telemedicine, and blockchain-driven electronic health records can improve efficiency, patient experience and health outcomes.

b.  New Payment Modalities: The shift from  traditional  fee-for-service to value-based  care models will reward providers for the quality of care they provide, not the quantity.  This should reduce unnecessary costs and incentivize preventive care.

c.  Aging Demographics: As the populations of the world’s most developed economies age, this will create increased demand for payors and providers.  A cautionary note, however, is that this trend may also increase costs as older individuals consume more healthcare services than younger ones, on average.

d.  Policy Support: The flipside of  costly regulation and  bureaucracy  are innovative public-private
partnerships that expand coverage, control costs, and improve outcomes.

e.  Subsector Consolidation/Vertical  Integration: The  ongoing consolidation  occurring  in both the payor  and  provider  subsectors  should  create  opportunities  for  economies  of  scale,  improved negotiating power, and sufficient scale to make the infrastructure investments required to achieve the  promise  of  new  technologies.

2.  Possible Subsector Headwinds:

a.  Political/Headline Risk: Particularly in this election year, large payors and providers are targets for policy makers seeking to find cost savings in the healthcare system.  At the minimum, this will create  short-term  volatility  as  the  market  responds  to  the  negative  press.    It  might  also  be  a precursor to regulation or legislation aimed at curbing the pricing power of the sector (e.g., witness pharmaceutical provisions in Inflation Reduction Act).

b.  Regulatory Challenges:  Frequent changes in healthcare laws, regulations, and policies can pose compliance  challenges  and  create  uncertainty.    This  can  increase  costs  and  require  constant adaptation.

c.  Cybersecurity Threats:  The flipside of the promise of AI in healthcare, as healthcare payors and providers move toward the increasing digitization of services, the opportunity for cybersecurity attacks increase as well.
d.  Aging Demographics: As mentioned above, while the aging of the consumer population creates increased healthcare demand, it also significantly increases patient acuity (severity of illness) and the prevalence of chronic diseases.  This drives the need for more costly and complex care. e.  Cap-Ex Requirements:   Building, maintaining and upgrading infrastructure to pursue such trends

as AI and cell and gene therapies will require significant capital investment.

f.  Workforce Shortages: The healthcare industry faces shortages of skilled professionals, including

doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, limiting the efficiency of care delivery.
