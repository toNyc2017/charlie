Additionally, Johnson & Johnson reported positive topline results from a Phase 3 pivotal study of Nipocalimab in treating generalized myasthenia gravis, as well as from a Phase 2 study in Sjögren’s Disease.

The company is also focusing on transforming the treatment of prostate and bladder cancer, as highlighted in their presentations at the ASCO GU conference.

In the MedTech field, Biosense Webster, a part of Johnson & Johnson, has submitted an application to the U.S. FDA for approval of its VARIPULSE platform, designed to treat Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation. Furthermore, Biosense Webster has received CE Mark approval in Europe for the same VARIPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) Platform, marking a significant step towards expanding its availability in the European market.
            Johnson & Johnson is actively expanding its influence in the healthcare sector, recently completing the acquisition of Ambrx and announcing plans to acquire Shockwave Medical. These strategic moves are part of the company's broader initiative to enhance its scientific leadership, particularly in combating cardiovascular diseases, as highlighted in their presentations at ACC.242.

In terms of financial health, Johnson & Johnson reported a robust capital allocation strategy for Q1 2024. The company prioritizes organic growth, maintaining competitive dividends, and engaging in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Johnson & Johnson has a significant cash reserve and marketable securities totaling approximately $26 billion, despite a net debt of $7 billion. The firm's free cash flow stands around $3 billion, demonstrating strong financial management.

Additionally, Johnson & Johnson invested $3.5 billion in research and development and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders through dividends in the first quarter of 2024. This financial strategy underscores the company's commitment to both growth and shareholder value.
            In Q1 2024, significant financial commitments were made, with $3.5 billion invested in R&D and $2.9 billion paid out in dividends to shareholders. The financial outlook for 2024 shows a strategic tightening of the range and an increase in the midpoint for operational sales and adjusted operational EPS, excluding impacts from the acquisition of Shockwave Medical.

The projected operational sales for April 2024 are estimated to be between $88.7 billion and $89.1 billion, with an adjusted pre-tax operating margin ranging from 5.5% to 6.0%. This represents a slight increase from January 2024's forecasts, which estimated operational sales between $88.2 billion and $89.0 billion and an adjusted pre-tax operating margin from 5.0% to 6.0%. The estimated reported sales for January ranged from $87.8 billion to $88.6 billion, with a pre-tax operating margin between 4.5% and 5.5%.

These figures underscore a focused approach to refining financial forecasts and enhancing shareholder returns amidst strategic acquisitions.
            The data presented indicates a financial forecast with specific figures and adjustments. The revenue midpoint is being increased to $88.2 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 5.0%, with an incremental foreign exchange impact of $0.3 billion or a 0.3% change. This adjustment leads to an improvement of approximately 50 basis points in financial metrics.

Net interest expense is projected to range between $450 million and $550 million, an increase based on first-quarter actuals. The effective tax rate is expected to remain steady at between 16.0% and 17.0%.

Regarding earnings per share (EPS), there is a tightening of the forecast range with an increase in the midpoint by $0.03, setting the adjusted operational EPS between $10.60 and $10.75, which translates to a growth rate of 6.9% to 8.4%. This adjustment reflects a slight increase from previous EPS forecasts of $10.55 to $10.75, indicating a robust financial outlook for the company.
            Johnson & Johnson is maintaining its financial guidance with a midpoint of $10.65, adjusting for an incremental foreign exchange impact of ($0.03). The company's financial results have been adjusted to reflect only its continuing operations, excluding intangible amortization expense, special items, acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of translational currency. Notably, the Euro is currently valued consistently at $1.08 for both the average and spot rates as of April 2024.

In the pharmaceutical sector, Johnson & Johnson anticipates a slightly stronger sales growth in the first half of the year compared to the second. This growth is driven by the continued uptake of recently launched products and the expected market entry of Stelara biosimilars in Europe around mid-year. Despite these developments, operational sales growth is expected to remain relatively stable throughout the year.

The company's financial calculations exclude costs related to the COVID-19 vaccine and are net of COGS, SM&A, and R&D expenses, providing a clearer picture of its operational performance. This approach highlights Johnson & Johnson's strategic focus on innovative medicine and MedTech, positioning it to potentially capitalize on market opportunities as they arise, albeit with an awareness of the challenges posed by new market entrants like biosimilars.
            Johnson & Johnson anticipates consistent operational sales growth throughout the year. The MedTech sector is seeing procedure volumes in 2024 that are still higher than pre-COVID levels, despite a modest impact from Russia sanctions in the first half of the year. The pricing for Surgical IOLs and Sports under the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) model in 2024 is expected to echo the impacts from 2023 throughout the year.

In terms of profitability, earnings per share (EPS) growth is projected to benefit from a reduction of 191 million shares in the first half of the year, with a partial benefit continuing into the third quarter.

Looking ahead, key events for Johnson & Johnson's Innovative Medicine Pipeline in 2024 include potential approvals in the US and EU, along with planned submissions in these regions. The leadership team, including Joaquin Duato (Chairman and CEO), Jennifer Taubert (Executive VP, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine), and others, are poised to steer these initiatives.
            Several pharmaceutical products are currently under review or planning for submission for various conditions in the US and EU markets. OPSUMIT (macitentan) is being considered for pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension in both regions. SIMPONI (golimumab) is being evaluated for pediatric ulcerative colitis in the EU. Additionally, clinical data for Phase III trials are expected for TREMFYA (guselkumab) in treating Crohn's Disease under the GALAXI study, and OPSYNVI (a combination of macitentan and tadalafil) is being reviewed for pulmonary arterial hypertension in the EU.

Other notable submissions include UPTRAVI (selexipag) for pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension in the EU, STELARA (ustekinumab) for pediatric Crohn's disease in the EU, and TREMFYA (guselkumab) as a monotherapy for ulcerative colitis in the QUASAR study. EDURANT (rilpivirine) is under consideration for pediatric HIV treatment in the EU, BALVERSA (erdafitinib) for urothelial cancer in the EU, nipocalimab for generalized myasthenia gravis, and TREMFYA (guselkumab) for pediatric psoriasis in the US. RYBREVANT (amivantamab) is being reviewed for subcutaneous administration in the PALOMA 3 study.

These developments indicate significant potential for expanding treatment options for various serious health conditions across different age groups, reflecting ongoing efforts to address unmet medical needs in the pharmaceutical industry.
            The text lists several pharmaceutical products along with their specific applications and regional approvals. RYBREVANT (amivantamab) is highlighted for treating Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in combination with chemotherapy under the PAPILLON study in the EU, and as a second-line treatment with lazertinib in the EU under the MARIPOSA-2 study. TREMFYA (guselkumab) is noted for various conditions including Crohn's Disease in the EU (GALAXI study), Pediatric Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis in the US, and Ulcerative Colitis as a monotherapy in the EU (QUASAR study).

ERLEADA (apalutamide) is being used for High-Risk Prostate Cancer in the PROTEUS study, and DARZALEX (daratumumab) is applied in the treatment of Frontline Multiple Myeloma for transplant eligible patients in both the US and EU under the PERSEUS study. Additionally, CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) is mentioned for Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma in the EU, and seltorexant is being used as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder with insomnia symptoms. REKAMBYS is being used for HIV treatment in adolescents in the EU, and nipocalimab is targeted for Generalized Myasthenia Gravis.

These products are at various stages of clinical or market deployment across different regions, indicating a robust pipeline and diverse therapeutic areas being addressed by these pharmaceutical interventions.
            The recent developments in pharmaceutical treatments by Johnson & Johnson include several significant advancements across various medical conditions. Notable among them is the progress in cancer treatments with RYBREVANT and lazertinib for non-small cell lung cancer in both the US and EU, under the MARIPOSA and MARIPOSA-2 studies. Additionally, TREMFYA (guselkumab) is making strides in treating inflammatory diseases, with ongoing studies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in various stages and regions, including the ASTRO and GRAVITI trials.

In the realm of mental health, aticaprant is being explored as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, while SPRAVATO (esketamine) is under investigation as a monotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in the TRD4005 Phase II study. Furthermore, Johnson & Johnson is exploring treatments in autoimmune diseases with nipocalimab for Sjogren's Disease and ongoing research in psoriatic arthritis.

The company is also focusing on combination therapies in oncology, as seen with TAR-200 (RIS/gemcitabine plus cetrelimab) for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in the SunRISe-1 study. Importantly, BALVERSA has achieved full approval in the US, marking a significant milestone.

As of April 16, 2024, Johnson & Johnson has confirmed the accuracy of this information and has stated that there is no obligation to update these details. This reflects a commitment to transparency and ongoing development in critical areas of medical need.



Item 1. Business
General
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.
MedTech 
The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery and Vision categories. Interventional Solutions include electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock, and Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) includes products and enabling technologies that support Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other. The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies (Ethicon), as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics (Mentor), and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision products include ACUVUE Brand contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
Geographic areas
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of Business – Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.
Raw materials
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
Patents
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key 
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings—Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 12.8% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA. The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expired in 2023. As a result of settlements and other agreements with third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA before January 1, 2025 in the United States. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent (Supplementary Protection Certificate) expires in 2024. 
Sales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 11.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound patent protection in select countries extends to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO.
Trademarks
The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
Seasonality
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for research and development activity.
Competition
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. 
Environment
The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.

2023 Annual Report

Regulation
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. 
The new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Within the U.S., an increasing number of U.S. States have enacted comprehensive privacy laws and federal regulators (e.g., the U.S. FDA, FTC and HHS) continue to stress the intersection of health and privacy as a compliance and enforcement priority. In the EU, multiple directives and laws (including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the AI Act) are rapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new enforcement risks. In addition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations, with more anticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer practices. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. These laws can also restrict transfers of data across borders, potentially impacting how data-driven health care solutions are developed and deployed globally in a compliant manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and availability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced regulation (e.g., White House’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence; the EU AI Act) to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of AI is underway that includes standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness, which will require compliance developments or enhancements. 
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has been required or directed to.
The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our pharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.
The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various state and federal transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners, including physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are a potent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare cost and access in the U.S.
Our business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published the first “Selected Drug” list, which includes XARELTO and STELARA as well as IMBRUVICA, which is developed in collaboration and co-commercialized in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. The Selected Drug list also included other medicines targeting disease states that are prevalent in the Medicare population. There remains uncertainty, however, regarding how the federal government will establish prices for the selected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. In any event, we anticipate that the selected products will be subjected to a government-established price for the Medicare population. 
The IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of inflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject manufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and CMS has yet to publicly announce the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs.
Additionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies, and other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to increase pricing transparency and controls. 
There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products.
In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant settlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure of personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.

Employees by region (in percentages)
Strategy
The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:
•Attracting and recruiting the best talent 
•Developing and retaining talent 
•Empowering and inspiring talent
Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.
Culture and employee engagement 
At the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must adhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2023, 94% of global employees across 76 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which was offered in 36 languages.
Growth and development 
To lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. In 2023, the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 7%. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently held Johnson & Johnson's first Global Learning Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building courses across five areas: leadership, business skills, digital upskilling, DEI, and well-being, on J&J Learn, the Company's new learning platform. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. The Company’s evidenced-based global enterprise Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy recognizes how DEI accelerates the Company's ability to meet the changing needs of the communities the Company serves in, as outlined in Our Credo. The Company’s DEI Vision is: Be yourself, change the world. The Company's DEI Mission is: Make diversity, equity and inclusion how we work everyday. The Company's enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to the DEI Vision and Mission and rests on four core pillars:

2023 Annual Report

Immunology products achieved sales of $18.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 6.6% as compared to the prior year. Increased sales of STELARA (ustekinumab) were primarily driven by patient mix, market growth, and continued strength in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth, continued strength in PsO/PsA (Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis) and patient mix. Additionally, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA growth was driven by growth outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar competition.
Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE. 
Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a result of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States.
Infectious disease products sales were $4.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 18.9% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA .
Neuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% as compared to the prior year. The growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by ongoing launches as well as increased physician confidence and patient demand. Growth was partially offset by declines in RISPERDAL/RISPERDAL CONSTA and the paliperidone long-acting injectables outside the U.S. due to the XEPLION loss of exclusivity in the European Union. 
Oncology products achieved sales of $17.7 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 10.5% as compared to the prior year. Sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by the ongoing launch, share gains and capacity improvement. Additionally, sales from the launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures. 
Pulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.8 billion, representing an increase of 11.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth was due to favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT (macitentan) partially offset by declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 5.5% as compared to the prior year. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and access changes. 
The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy had discount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2023.
During 2023, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:

The Surgery franchise sales were $10.0 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% from 2022. The growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by Biosurgery global procedure growth and strength of the portfolio as well as uptake of new products in Endocutters and Energy. The growth was partially offset by competitive pressures and volume-based procurement impacts in Endocutters and Energy. The growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by increased procedures coupled with technology penetration and benefits from the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio. 
The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 4.1% from 2022. The growth in hips reflects global procedure growth and continued strength of the portfolio partially offset by volume-based procurement impacts and Russia sanctions. The growth in knees was primarily driven by procedures, benefits from recent product additions to the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. This was partially offset by stocking dynamics, primarily outside the U.S. The growth in Trauma was driven by global procedures and the adoption of recently launched products. This was partially offset by volume-based procurement impacts. The growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by Digital Solutions, Shoulders, Sports and Craniomaxillofacial products partially offset by Russia sanctions and supply constraints, primarily outside the U.S. 
The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 47.7% from 2022, which includes sales from Abiomed acquired on December 22, 2022. Electrophysiology grew by double digits due to global procedure growth, new product performance and commercial execution. This was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China. Abiomed sales reflect the strength of all commercialized regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP. 
The Vision franchise achieved sales of $5.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 4.6% from 2022. The Contact Lenses/Other growth was primarily driven by the continued strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family including recent launches and commercial execution. This was partially offset by impacts of U.S. stocking dynamics, Russia sanctions, impacts from strategic portfolio decisions and supply challenges. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by cataract procedure growth, continued strength of recent innovations and reduction of prior year stocking outside the U.S. This was partially offset by softer Refractive and premium IOL markets and Russia sanctions.

Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication and HS indication became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for both AD and HS. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020. 
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), changes in the fair value of securities, investment (income)/loss related to employee benefit programs, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition and divestiture related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.
Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2023 was unfavorable by $5.8 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:

(Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense | 2023 | 2022 | Change
Litigation related(1) | $6.9 | 0.9 | 6.0 
Changes in the fair value of securities(2) | 0.6 | 0.7 | (0.1) 
COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs | 0.4 | 0.7 | (0.3) 
Acquisition, Integration and Divestiture related(3) | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.1 
Employee benefit plan related | (1.4) | (1.2) | (0.2) 
Other | (0.2) | (0.5) | 0.3 
Total Other (Income) Expense, Net | $6.6 | 0.8 | 5.8 

(1)2023 was primarily related to the approximately $7.0 billion charge for talc (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details) and favorable intellectual property related litigation settlements of approximately $0.3 billion. 2022 was primarily related to pelvic mesh. 
(2)The fiscal 2023 includes $0.4 billion related to the unfavorable change in the fair value of the remaining stake in Kenvue and $0.4 billion related to the partial impairment of Idorsia convertible debt and the change in the fair value of the Idorsia equity securities held.
(3)2023 primarily related to the impairment of Ponvory and one-time integration costs related to the acquisition of Abiomed. 2022 was primarily costs related to the acquisition of Abiomed. 
Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in the fiscal year 2023 was $1.3 billion as compared to interest income of $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2022 primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. Interest expense in the fiscal year 2023 was $0.8 billion as compared to interest expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates on debt balances. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $22.9 billion at the end of 2023, and averaged $22.6 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $22.3 billion and $26.9 billion average balance in 2022. The total debt balance at the end of 2023 was $29.3 billion with an average debt balance of $34.5 billion as compared to $39.6 billion at the end of 2022 and an average debt balance of $36.7 billion. The lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed in late December of 2022. The lower average debt balance was primarily due to the repayment of commercial paper.

2023 Annual Report

Innovative Medicine segment: 
In 2023, the Innovative Medicine segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.3% versus 29.8% in 2022. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:
•Lower one-time COVID-19 Vaccine related exit costs of $0.7 billion in 2023 versus $1.5 billion in 2022
•Lower In-process research & development impairments of $0.2 billion in 2023 versus $0.8 billion in 2022
•Unfavorable changes in the fair value of securities in 2023 of $0.4 billion as compared to $0.7 billion in 2022
•Lower litigation related expense of $0.2 billion 
•Leveraging in selling and marketing expenses
•R&D Portfolio prioritization
partially offset by 
•Restructuring charges of $0.5 billion in 2023 versus $0.1 billion in 2022
•Impairment of Ponvory in 2023
•Higher milestone payments in 2023
MedTech segment: 
In 2023, the MedTech segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 15.4% versus 16.2% in 2022. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:
•Higher amortization expense of $0.5 billion in 2023 related to Abiomed
•Expense of $0.4 billion for an acquired in process research and development asset from the Laminar acquisition in 2023
•Commodity inflation in 2023
partially offset by
•Income from litigation settlements of $0.1 billion in 2023 versus expense of $0.6 billion in 2022
•Lower integration/acquisition costs related to Abiomed of $0.2 billion in 2023 versus $0.3 billion in 2022
•Leveraging in selling and marketing expenses in 2023
Restructuring: In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. 
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $40 million was recorded in Restructuring and $279 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, primarily included inventory and instrument charges related to market and product exits. 
In 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion related to a restructuring program of its Global Supply Chain. The Global Supply Chain program was announced in the second quarter of 2018 and was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. 
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.
Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 11.5% in 2023 and 15.4% in 2022. 
On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. As of December 31, 2023, several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar 2 legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as result of this legislation the 2024 effective tax rate will increase by approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation, guidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well as other business events, may impact this estimate.
For discussion related to the fiscal 2023 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Liquidity and capital resources
Liquidity & cash flows
Cash and cash equivalents were $21.9 billion at the end of 2023 as compared to $14.1 billion at the end of 2022. 
The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $7.8 billion increase were:

(Dollars in billions)

(0.1) | other and rounding 
$(15.8) | Net cash used for financing activities 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2023, the net debt position was $6.4 billion as compared to the prior year of $17.4 billion. The debt balance at the end of 2023 was $29.3 billion as compared to $39.6 billion in 2022. Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.1 billion and the establishment of the approximately $9 billion reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. 
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of $22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet. 
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2023.
Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer, 
Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock. In the fiscal year 2022, approximately $2.5 billion was repurchased under the program. In the fiscal year 2023, $2.5 billion has been repurchased and the repurchase program was completed.
The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 31, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

2023 Annual Report

Financing and market risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.6 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.8 billion. 
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2023, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 5, 2024. The Company early terminated the additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which had an expiration of November 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2023 and 2022 were $29.3 billion and $39.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in the debt balance was due to the repayment of commercial paper. In 2023, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $6.4 billion compared to net debt of $17.4 billion in 2022. Total debt represented 30.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2023 and 34.0% of total capital in 2022. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2023 was $28.57 compared to $29.39 at year-end 2022.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Dividends
The Company increased its dividend in 2023 for the 61st consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.70 per share in 2023 and $4.45 per share in 2022. 
On January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on March 5, 2024 to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2024.

Other information
Critical accounting policies and estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and 2021 are included in sales to customers.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.

(1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $740 million at December 31, 2023 and $802 million at January 1, 2023, recorded as a contra asset.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.
See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. 
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. 

2023 Annual Report

See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.
Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Economic and market factors
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2013 - 2023, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey (beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
In December 2023, the Argentine government devalued the peso by approximately 50%. During 2023, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $130 million related to operations in Argentina due to the application of highly inflationary accounting. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s Argentine subsidiaries represented less than 1.0% of the Company's consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues and profits from continuing operations; therefore, the effect of a change in the exchange rate is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's 2024 full-year results.
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme.
Russia-Ukraine War
Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.
In early March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare purposes.
Conflict in the Middle East
Although the long-term implications of Israel's conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2023 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4 billion and net income by approximately $0.2 billion.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. 
The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and reimbursement of healthcare products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.

2023 Annual Report

The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.
Legal proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings.

(1)Previously in Other Oncology 
Immunology products achieved operational growth of 4.6% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales of STELARA (ustekinumab) were driven by market growth and share gains in Inflammatory Bowel Disease partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains. Additionally, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA growth was driven by growth outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar competition.
Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a result of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent (Supplementary Protection Certificate) expires in 2024 in most European Union Member States and the United Kingdom.
Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.
Infectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 48.3% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. The Company expects an insignificant amount of COVID-19 vaccine revenue in fiscal 2024.
Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 2.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. The growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by increased physician and patient demand. Growth was partially offset by declines in RISPERDAL CONSTA.
Oncology products achieved operational sales growth of 18.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth. Increased sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and the launch of TALVEY (talquetamab) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab) in Other Oncology contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to global competitive pressures.
Pulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 22.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth was due to favorable patient mix, market growth and share gains from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT (macitentan).
Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 10.5% as compared to the same period a year ago. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and share loss.
The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. 
MedTech
The MedTech segment sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 were $7.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the same period a year ago, which included operational growth of 6.3% and a negative currency impact of 1.8%. U.S. MedTech sales increased 6.6%. International MedTech sales increased by 2.4%, including operational growth of 6.1% and a negative currency impact of 3.7%. In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the MedTech segment operational sales growth was a negative 0.2%.

The Surgery franchise achieved operational sales growth of 1.9% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by competitive pressures and volume-based procurement impacts in Endocutters and Energy partially offset by Biosurgery global procedure growth, strength of the portfolio and commercial execution as well as uptake of new products in Endocutters and Energy. The operational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by increased procedures coupled with technology penetration and upgrades within the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio. The growth was partially offset by fewer selling days.
The Orthopaedics franchise achieved operational sales growth of 4.8% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. The fiscal first quarter of 2024, includes a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all Orthopaedic platforms in the U.S. which positively impacted the worldwide Orthopaedics franchise growth by approximately 3.0%. The operational growth in Hips reflects global procedure growth, continued strength of the portfolio and the aforementioned revenue recognition timing change partially offset by Russia Sanctions and one less selling day. The operational growth in Knees was primarily driven by procedures, continued strength of the ATTUNE portfolio, pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution, the aforementioned revenue recognition timing change and timing of tenders outside the U.S. partially offset by one less selling day. The operational growth in Trauma was driven by the aforementioned revenue recognition timing change and the continued adoption of recently launched products. This was partially offset by U.S. competitive challenges, one less selling day, weather-related softness in core trauma and volume-based procurement impacts. The operational growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by growth in Digital Solutions, Craniomaxillofacial, Shoulders, and the aforementioned revenue recognition timing change partially offset by Spine competitive pressures and one less selling day. 
The Cardiovascular franchise (previously referred to as Interventional Solutions) achieved operational sales growth of 22.5% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. Electrophysiology grew by double digits due to global procedure growth, new product uptake, commercial execution and Asia Pacific distributor inventory dynamics partially offset by the impacts of volume-

based procurement in China and fewer selling days. Abiomed sales reflect the strength of all major commercialized regions driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP.
The Vision franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. The Contact Lenses/Other operational decline was primarily driven by U.S. stocking dynamics, the impact of the Blink divestiture in the fiscal third quarter of 2023 and economic pressures in Asia Pacific partially offset by the continued strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products (including recent launches) and price actions. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the continued strength of recent innovations and commercial execution partially offset by preparation for volume-based procurement implementation in China and refractive softness in the U.S.
Analysis of consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $3.7 billion representing 17.4% of sales as compared to a loss of $1.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2023, representing (6.2)% of sales.
Cost of products sold

In-process research and development (IPR&D) impairments
In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $0.1 billion associated with the IPR&D acquired with Pulsar Vascular in 2016. 
Interest (income) expense
Interest income in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $364 million as compared to $198 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. Interest expense in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $155 million as compared to $212 million in the same period a year ago primarily due to a lower average debt balance. The balance of cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities was $26.2 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 as compared to $32.3 billion (including $7.7 billion of restricted cash related to Kenvue) at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The Company’s debt position was $33.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, as compared to $52.9 billion the same period a year ago (including $7.7 billion related to Kenvue debt).

Worldwide income (loss) before tax | $3,714 | $(1,287) | $21,383 | $20,894 | 17.4 | % | | (6.2) | %

(1)Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense, certain litigation expenses and general corporate (income) expense. The fiscal first quarters of 2024 and 2023 include charges for talc matters of $2.7 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. 
Innovative Medicine segment
The Innovative Medicine segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was 36.6% versus 32.8% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:
•One-time COVID-19 Vaccine related exit costs of $0.4 billion in 2023
•Favorable patient mix in Cost of products sold
partially offset by
•An increase in brand marketing investment
•Higher administrative costs 
•Higher investments in research and development
MedTech segment
The MedTech segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was 19.4% versus 18.8% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:
•An IPR&D charge in 2023 of approximately $0.1 billion related to the Pulsar Vascular acquisition in the fiscal year 2016
•Research and development expense phasing
partially offset by
•Macroeconomic factors and unfavorable currency in Cost of products sold
Restructuring
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 billion in both the fiscal first quarters of 2024 and 2023, included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. Total project costs of approximately $0.6 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. 
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within its MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $27 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, of which $20 million was recorded in Restructuring and $7 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, primarily included costs related to market and product exits. Total project costs of approximately $0.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.

Form 10-Q

Provision for taxes on income
The worldwide effective income tax rate for the fiscal three months was 12.4% in 2024 and 61.8% in 2023.
On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. Several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as result of this legislation the 2024 effective tax rate will increase by 1.5% (150 basis points) compared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation, guidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well as other business events, may impact this estimate. 
For further details related to the 2024 provision for taxes refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide and has the ability to issue up to $20 billion in Commercial Paper. Furthermore, in September 2023, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion (expiration on September 5, 2024) which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our commercial paper borrowings. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. 

Form 10-Q

As of March 31, 2024, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately $26.2 billion and had approximately $33.6 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net debt position of $7.4 billion as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter net debt position of $20.6 billion (which included cash of $1.7 billion and debt of $7.7 billion related to Kenvue). The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company’s remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.1 billion and the approximately $11.0 billion ($13.7 billion nominal) reserve remaining for the talc settlement proposal (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.
Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company paid approximately $2.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury, including $2.0 billion related to the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023) and $0.6 billion primarily related to the normal estimated payment for the fiscal first quarter of 2024.
Dividends
On January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on March 5, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2024. 
On April 16, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on June 4, 2024, to shareholders of record as of May 21, 2024. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.

Economic and market factors
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.
Russia-Ukraine war
Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of the fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2024, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.
In March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare purposes.
Conflict in the Middle East
Although the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of the fiscal three months ending March 31, 2024, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented approximately 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.
Other Macroeconomic Considerations
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. 
The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.
The Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products prior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company’s patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.

Jessica Moore
Hello everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the first quarter business results and our full year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder you can find additional materials including today’s presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording, and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SECs website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.
Moving to today's agenda I will start by reviewing the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato our Chairman and CEO as well as Jennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech leaders will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Unless otherwise stated the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.
Turning to our first quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the first quarter of 2024. Sales increased 3.9% with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide and 7.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was 6%.
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter net earnings were $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.20 versus basic loss per share of $0.19 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.71, representing increases of 3.8% and 12.4%, respectively compared to the first quarter of 2023. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12.8%.
I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.6 billion increased 2.5%, with growth of 8.4% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.3%, both worldwide and outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continued to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21%, primarily driven by share gains of six points across all lines of therapy and ten points in the front line setting.
As of this quarter, we are now disclosing TECVAYLI sales, which were previously reported in other oncology. Sales achieved $133 million in the quarter, compared to $63 million in the first quarter of last year, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $157 million, compared to $72 million in the first quarter of last year, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. While sequential growth was roughly flat due to phasing, we continued to anticipate quarter-over-quarter growth with acceleration in the back half of the year.
Other oncology growth was driven by continuing strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific, and RYBREVANT our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Also in oncology, ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 28.4%, primarily driven by share gains. Growth of 22.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains, and market growth for both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. As a reminder, favorable patient mix was a driver in Q2 2023 through Q1 2024. Therefore, while we still anticipate growth, we expect to lap this dynamic beginning in Q2 2024.
Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 27.6%, driven by market growth and share gains. STELARA growth of 1.1% was driven by market growth and share gains in IBD, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in the U.S. and as expected, share loss in PSO and PSA. We anticipate continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry. In neuroscience SPRAVATO growth of 72% continues to be driven by share gains and additional market launches. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, which we anticipate continuing throughout the year, as well as a decrease in IMBRUVICA due to competitive pressures, partially offset by stocking dynamics in the U.S. Finally, it is worth noting distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in Q4.
I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 6.3%, with growth in the U.S. of 6.6% and 6.1% outside of the U.S. In the quarter, worldwide MedTech growth was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to fewer selling days, disproportionately impacting orthopedics. In cardiovascular previously referred to as Interventional Solutions, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.9%, with strong growth in all regions. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, commercial execution, and a onetime inventory build in Asia-Pacific, impacting worldwide growth by approximately 370 basis points. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15%, driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology.
Orthopedics growth of 4.8% includes a onetime revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the U.S. positively impacting worldwide growth by approximately 300 basis points. As a reminder, orthopedics was over indexed by the impact of reduced selling days in the quarter. Strong performance in hips and knees was driven by procedure recovery, growth of new products, and commercial execution. While trauma and spine were negatively impacted by competitive pressures and core trauma was further impacted by weather related softness in the U.S. Growth of 1.9% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our bio-surgery and wound closure portfolios, partially offset by competitive pressures in China volume based procurement and energy and endo cutters.
Contact lenses declined 2.3%, driven by U.S. stocking dynamics, partially offset by strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-day family of products. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 120 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3 2023. Surgical Vision grew 1.1%, driven by TECNIS EYHANCE, our monofocal intraocular lens partially offset by China's VBP.
Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin leveraged by 160 basis points, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 supply network related exit cost. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 110 basis points, driven primarily by timing of marketing investment in the Innovative Medicine business.
We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels investing $3.5 billion, or 16.6% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.9 billion, or 21.4% of sales in Innovative Medicine, with the increase in investment being driven by continued pipeline progression. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.6 billion, or 8.3% of sales, a slight decrease driven by phasing. Interest income was $209 million in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $14 million of expense in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in income was driven by a lower average debt balance and higher interest rates earned on cash balances.
Other income and expense was income of $322 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to an expense of $6.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This change was primarily due to the $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.9% versus 61.8% in the same period last year, which was primarily driven by the tax benefit on the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters.
Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2024 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales increased from 36.1% to 36.8%, primarily driven by an increase in non-allocated interest income with both Innovative Medicine and MedTech margins remaining relatively flat year-over-year. When comparing against the fourth quarter and full year 2023, Innovative Medicine and MedTech adjusted income before tax margins have improved.
This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe.
Joseph J. Wolk
Thank you, Jessica. Hello, everyone. As you just heard, we are off to a solid financial start in 2024, complemented by sustained momentum within our Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines, marked by significant regulatory and clinical milestones.
Before we delve into segment highlights from the quarter, I want to touch upon some important announcements that we made that will further enhance our competitive positioning. Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Shockwave Medical. Johnson & Johnson has a long history of addressing cardiovascular disease through both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses. The acquisition of Shockwave with its leading intravascular lithotripsy or IVL technology will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, two of the highest growth innovation oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention. This addition is not only adjacent to our other cardiovascular businesses but also consistent with our strategy of becoming a best-in-class MedTech company. During the first quarter, we also expanded our Innovative Medicine portfolio with the completion of the Ambrx acquisition. With its promising pipeline and ADC platform, Ambrx will further strengthen our oncology portfolio and ability to deliver enhanced precision biologics that treat cancer.
Now I'll move to segment highlights from the quarter. As Jessica previously shared, our growth in Innovative Medicine continues to be driven by momentum from key brands and the adoption of new products. During the quarter, we hit several regulatory and clinical targets that are key to delivering longer-term growth. Starting with oncology, in multiple myeloma, we received FDA approval and a positive CHMP opinion for CARVYKTI for patients who have received at least one prior therapy, making it the only BCMA targeting treatment available for patients in the second-line setting.
We also received biweekly dosing approval from the FDA for TECVAYLI, the only approved BCMA targeting bispecific antibody that provides patients with dosing flexibility. And finally, we submitted an application to the EMA for regulatory approval for DARZALEX-based quadruplet therapy and were granted U.S. priority review by the FDA. In addition, we made significant steps forward in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. The approval was based on data from the Phase III PAPILLON Study. We also received priority review from the FDA and submitted a filing to the EMA for RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation non-small cell lung cancer. The priority review and filing to the EMA are supported by data from the landmark Phase 3 Mariposa Study.
Turning to our immunology portfolio, we submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA seeking approval for TREMFYA in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We are looking forward to presenting data from the Phase 3 QUASAR Study evaluating TREMFYA in patients with ulcerative colitis at Digestive Disease Week in May. We also significantly advanced our pipeline with important data readouts including positive top-line results from the Frontier 2 study demonstrating JNJ2113 as the first and only investigational targeted oral peptide that maintains skin clearance in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through one year. Nipocalimab also delivered positive topline results in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in adults with Sjögren’s Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, respectively. We also received FDA breakthrough designation in the treatment of HDFN, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, and fast-track designation for FNAIT, a rare and potentially fatal blood disorder in infants.
Looking ahead, we expect upcoming data readouts for ERLEADA in localized prostate cancer as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 results for our combination therapy JNJ4804 in psoriatic arthritis as well as pivotal data from TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer which will be presented at the American Urological Association Annual Meeting in May. Lastly, we're excited to present our Phase 3 TREMFYA Crohn's disease data as well as our Sub-Q data for RYBREVANT at upcoming medical meetings.
In MedTech, notable highlights in the first quarter includes significant advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio. In Pulsed Field Ablation, we received CE Mark approval for VARIPULSE based on the 12-month INSPIRE Study which demonstrated 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence and zero primary adverse events. We filed for U.S. approval of VARIPULSE based on the ADMIRE Study which showed all pilot phase patients achieved acute success and 80% remaining free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after one year. We also submitted a CE Mark filing for our Dual Energy Smart Touch SF Catheter, which will provide physicians the optionality for RF and PFA energy sources in one catheter.
We began enrollment of patients in a pivotal trial evaluating Laminar's left atrial appendage elimination device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the late-breaking DanGer Shock Study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirmed routine use of Abiomed’s Impella CP in patients who have had a heart attack with STEMI cardiogenic shock reduced 180-day mortality by 12.7%. In vision we launched TECNIS PURE C, a next-generation presbyopia-correcting lens for cataract patients in EMEA. We also presented new data for our presbyope correcting IOL, TECNIS Odyssey at the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in April.
Looking ahead, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology pipeline with the full U.S. market release of the QDOT microcatheter, the U.S. commercial launch of Abiomed Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist as well as the submission of Impella ECP. Within our robotic surgery pipeline, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Otava [ph] in the second half of 2024.
Turning to financials, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended the first quarter with $26.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $33.6 billion of debt for a net debt position of $7.4 billion. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the first quarter of approximately $3 billion. This was above the first quarter of 2023, which included the consumer health business cash flow. Also in the first quarter of 2024, we incurred elevated payment levels made in furtherance of achieving a responsible, final, and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. We continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position and ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities.
Innovation continues to be a main priority for the company, as demonstrated by our industry-leading R&D spend. During the first quarter, we invested more than $3.5 billion in research and development or 16.6% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders through our dividend. We appreciate the value our investors place on the dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 4.2% increase marking our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. As we stated previously, we are disciplined in our approach to inorganic growth and prioritize acquisitions that strategically fit and present meaningful long-term growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the pending transaction in which we are adding a profitable commercialized portfolio of Shockwave Technologies in high-growth markets as well as a robust pipeline.
I'll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance, which excludes the recently announced acquisition of Shockwave. As previously communicated, we assume the closing of the transaction will take place by midyear 2024 at which time we will update our guidance to reflect the expected dilution to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 of approximately $0.10 per share driven by financing costs. Based on the results delivered in the first quarter, we are tightening our ranges and increasing the midpoint for our full year operational sales and adjusted operational EPS guidance. As such, we expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% or $88.7 billion to $89.1 billion increasing the midpoint by $300 million or 0.3%. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales.
As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.09. As of last week, the Euro spot rate was 1.08, a modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar also experienced by a handful of other currencies. As a result, we now estimate a negative full year foreign currency impact of $700 million resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% at the midpoint, consistent with last quarter's guidance. We are maintaining other elements of our guidance provided on January's earnings call, with the exception of two items, we are increasing interest income to a range of $550 million to $650 million.
We are also tightening the range of our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance from $10.60 to $10.75, increasing the midpoint by $0.03 to $10.68, reflecting year-on-year growth of 7.7%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year estimates a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.03 per share. As a result, the reported adjusted earnings per share remains unchanged at $10.65, reflecting 7.4% growth versus 2023. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect that the same qualitative considerations provided during January's earnings call to remain intact. We anticipate Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half given the anticipated entry of STELARA Biosimilars in Europe midyear.
For MedTech we expect operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts in the pipeline that will drive meaningful near and long-term growth across both Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We look forward to advancing our pipelines in both segments to deliver innovative treatments, solving some of the most complex health challenges. This wouldn't be possible without our employees around the world, so it's only appropriate before turning to your questions that we recognize and thank our colleagues for their continued hard work, commitment, and dedication to patients. I'm pleased to be joined by Joaquin, Jennifer, John and Tim for the Q&A and kindly ask Kevin to provide instructions to initiate that portion of the call.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Terence Flynn
Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a two-part on myeloma. First, on CARVYKTI, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the phasing comments that impacted sales in the quarter? And then secondly, on TECVAYLI, how should we think about growth for this product, it looks like it's been somewhat flattish over the last couple of quarters, but just wondering if TALVEY had an impact there, so as we think about those franchises back half of this year, maybe you could provide high-level commentary? Thank you.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you, Terence, for your question. And before we go into the specifics of your question on CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI and TALVEY, our multiple myeloma franchise, let me share with all of you some reflections on this quarter. We are entering 2024 in a position of strength, and I'm particularly encouraged on the performance of our strategic platforms, the ones that are going to drive growth in the second half of the decade.
In Innovative Medicines, DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA all grew over 20% and specifically on TREMFYA, now we have more sales in our psoriasis and psoriatic arthritic indications than we do with STELARA and we have high expectations for the brand with ulcerative colitis data to be presented at the Digestive Disease Week just a few weeks from now and also data on Crohn's Disease to be presented also this year. We continue to see increased demand from our new product launches, SPRAVATO, TECVAYLI, TALVEY, CARVYKTI with CARVYKTI just a few weeks ago receiving FDA approval to move into the second line setting.
Now let me move into MedTech. We have demonstrated a strong performance across cardiovascular, in electrophysiology and Abiomed and we have made significant progress with our PSA portfolio. We also have delivered several important capital allocation milestones in Q1, investing heavily in R&D, raising our dividend for the 62nd consecutive year closing the Ambrx acquisition and announcing the planned acquisition of Shockwave Medical. As you have heard from Joe in his prepared remarks, we continue to make progress on achieving a responsible final and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation.
Overall, I'm proud of the performance in the quarter, both in terms of the solid financial but also the numerous pipeline advancements. It is a solid start of the year that puts us in a position of strength for 2024. And it also the sustained progress gives us -- give me great confidence in achieving our long-term growth goals of operational sales compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030. Overall, it gives me great confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson, now to Jennifer on your question, Terence, on CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY.
Jennifer L. Taubert
Thanks, Joaquin. Hello Terence and good morning everybody. Just also a quick shout out and a big thanks to our Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world, delivering 8.3% adjusted operational growth, definitely above-market growth for the quarter, with strength being really across our core launch, our core and launch brands, nine brands achieving double-digit growth, 10 actually, if you include TALVEY in that mix. A strong pipeline progress that Joaquin noted and also the announcement and closing of our acquisition of Ambrx really to add another key pipeline asset for us as well as key technology that can help us in ADCs. So really strong quarter all the way around.
With respect to your question specifically in multiple myeloma and then CARVYKTI and TALVEY, multiple myeloma continues to be a true stronghold for us, and we had significant performance and growth across the board in those assets during the quarter. I can start off real quickly with DARZALEX with 21% growth, predominantly with that growth coming in the frontline setting and also it was noted that [indiscernible] data has been filed, which will offer us an additional expansion in frontline. For CARVYKTI, we had over 100% growth versus the first quarter of 2023, very, very strong demand. We did have both the ADCOM in the United States, which results in an unanimous recommendation for approval and then the subsequent to the end of the quarter, approval of CARVYKTI for that line two plus which we think bodes very well. I know there's always questions on how are we doing and where we're expanding our capacity, given the strength of the data and the additional data that's coming through in indications. I'm real happy to say we have doubled our manufacturing capacity since the beginning of 2023 for cell processing. We are continuing to work on our Gant [ph] facility to have that as a secondary source of supply. We brought on some contract manufacturers, and we have completely transformed and expanded antivirus production so that, that's not a rate-limiting step for us.
So I know we were a flat -- roughly flat quarter-to-quarter from 4Q to 1Q as noted, that really just was some phasing and timing of orders and when they were actually delivered and built for nothing that -- anything to really see there. We do anticipate continued growth for this asset, particularly second half versus the first half as we continue to add more slots and expand our capacity. And based on the data and everything that we're seeing, we've continued to have a lot of optimism for how CARVYKTI is performing.
Likewise, as it relates to TECVAYLI, the TECVAYLI launch is going very well around the world. Consistently, we're seeing very strong uptake and rapid adoption, whether we're in the U.S., Germany, Austria, France, the major markets that have launched to date and really as the first and we believe best-in-class off-the-shelf BCMA bispecific, we really believe that, that therapy is offering deep and durable responses. And so a lot of optimism for continuing to drive the launch there. The product is performing well in the later line settings and is also performing very well from a competitive standpoint.
And last but not least is actually TALVEY, which is our 10th product with double-digit growth, although that falls in the all other oncology categories. So we're not fully breaking that out yet. But very, very strong uptake as the first in GPRC5D off-the-shelf by bispecific as well. So I think what this really means is we have got fabulous opportunities across lines of therapy with what we believe are truly best-in-class agents and many of these agents have potential as well to be combined as we work towards curing multiple myeloma. So a significant business for us, and I'm very positive on our outlook for the rest of the year and going forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.
Lawrence Biegelsen
Good morning, thanks for taking the question. A question for Tim. Your MedTech business grew 6.5% on an adjusted operational basis in Q1, but there were a number of onetime items. What was the net impact from those onetime items in your view and what are you seeing around the world from a procedure standpoint and what are your expectations for the rest of the year? Thank you.
Timothy Schmid
Well, thank you for the question, Larry. And let me maybe just reflect a little on the journey that we've been on. As you know, we surpassed $30 billion last year with adjusted operational growth of 7.8%. And I think it's important to note that when we compare ourselves against the majority of the competitors within our competitive composite, we are double their size. So that is performance that we are particularly proud of. We've now followed that up with another solid quarter of 6.3% growth in the first quarter.
Now Larry, to your point, there has been some noise in that. We are particularly proud of the tremendous double-digit growth within our Electrophysiology business. And to put that in context, this is a business that is nearing on $5 billion, growing north of 20%. And I think that really calls out the leadership position, which we're continuing to build on and couldn't be more excited about the progress we're making in PFA, which we believe also will continue to drive that performance.
There has been some noise specifically in relation to our Vision business. But please rest assured, we are extremely confident in the underlying health of our Vision portfolio. This is a business that grew 6.6% last year, and we expect it to grow in high single-digit performance this year. There has been some stocking issues related to distributor inventory, which was the predominant driver of the performance you see this year. But once again, very confident that we'll see that return to strong single-digit performance for the remainder of the year. There have been a couple of one-timers both in terms of selling days, as we mentioned earlier, about 80 bps of selling days and then a revenue recognition change within our orthopedics business, which impacted that business by about 300 basis points. But all in all, a strong quarter Larry, and we remain very committed to strong high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year for 2024. Thank you.
Joseph J. Wolk
Larry, I just want to maybe add on to Tim's good comments there. The one timers, there was tailwinds and headwinds in that number. So the 6.3% that you're seeing is 6.5% is pretty much a true number when you consider both sides of the equation.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.
Christopher Schott
Great, thanks so much for the question. I think BD type question here. I guess following the Shockwave acquisition, what's the appetite, I guess, for further away, maybe talk about like larger tuck-in type transactions either in your MedTech or Pharma business. It just seems like the portfolio and the pipeline at J&J has evolved pretty nicely over the past few years and I'm interested if you think the business is now at a point where we can think about maybe smaller earlier-stage assets as the primary focus for BD or do you still have a greater sense of urgency either in MedTech or pharma to add some of these kind of bolt-on type transactions going forward? Thanks so much.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you, Chris, and this is Joaquin. I'm glad that you recognize the strategic consistency of our M&A trajectory, and that's good. Our M&A strategy looks for the long term. So it's not going to change. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to be disciplined and M&A, it's going to be -- remain a critical component of that. And it's important for me to underline that with the strength of our cash flow and our balance sheet, we have significant flexibility to consider multiple types of transactions, as you mentioned. And what we have done so far is a demonstration of that with Abiomed, Laminar, Ambrx, and now the planned acquisition of Shockwave, all of them are good examples of our study consistency and the principles that we have outlined to you. So that is not going to change. Our M&A strategy is not going to change.
We'll continue to evaluate opportunities agnostic to the sector and size and what we are looking for, it's a number of components. One, does this technology improve the current standard of care. That's critical for us. To what extent we believe there is a patient impact, which is positive. Number two, does it -- is it consistent with the capabilities and knowledge that we have in-house. We see a correlation between that and the success in the acquisitions. Number three, does it enable us to enter into higher growth markets, so areas that are growing in which we can continue to develop that market. And finally, and very important for us, does it continue to deliver a compelling financial result for our shareholders. So that's our M&A strategy, and it's been a cornerstone of our ability to create value. I am glad that you recognize the consistency that we have deployed, and it's not going to change looking into the future. When we think about M&A, we think in decades, we don't think opportunistically.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.
Joanne Wuensch
Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Can you maybe circle back to Vision Care, please and can we unpack the different parts that are positive and negatives on the IO and the contact lens business? Thank you.
Joaquin Duato
Of course, Joanne and thank you for bringing this up because it does look odd and certainly isn't consistent with our expectations or the performance that we expect going forward from that business. As I mentioned earlier, this is a business that grew 6.6% in 2023 and actually consistently grows in high single-digit. We absolutely believe in the underlying health of our Vision business and that it remains strong and continues to perform above market. As I mentioned earlier, the Q1 performance was predominantly driven by a contraction of U.S. distributor inventory in contact lens. As we have mentioned in the past, we had some variability in terms of our supply, which resulted in changes within distributor inventory. We've now started to see that as our supply for contact lenses has stabilized, we've started to see a normalization of the inventory that our distributors are carrying on hand. And so that is the big driver in the results that you see today.
As you know, in contact lens, this is an annuity business where it's all about how you gain your fair share of new users, while at the same time, protecting the base. We are incredibly pleased with the ongoing performance of our premium ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family and we are seeing unprecedented share gains in multifocal. I will also say that if we look at sequential share gains across the contact lens business, we are seeing sequential gains, which should bode well for continued performance for the remainder of the year.
Specifically to IOLs, as you know, we are not currently market leader, but we are expecting to deliver the fourth consecutive year of global share gains driven primarily by tremendous performances of our IOL business in Asia Pac and in EMEA. We're also excited, as you heard from Jess earlier by the limited market release of our TECNIS PureSee and Odyssey next-gen multifocals and we'll see a full release occur through the remainder of the year. So once again, very confident that you will see tremendous improvement in the performance of that business, and we expect high single-digit growth for Vision for 2024.
Thank you Joanne.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Chris Shibutani
Great, thank you very much. Good morning. If I could ask about the Pulmonary Hypertension business. This quarter, quite strong. You mentioned, in particular, share gains and favorable patient mix, if you could help us understand that a little bit better? And then on the forward, the pulmonary arterial hypertension segment is anticipated to see some disruption with the introduction of the recently approved product from Merck, WINREVAIR. Can you comment on what you're thinking the portfolio will perform and how that market will respond to this anticipated shift? Thank you.
Jennifer L. Taubert
Hi Chris, it's Jennifer. So yes, we're really pleased with our Pulmonary Hypertension results for the first quarter with both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, delivering strong growth that was both volume and share gains in the market as well as some favorable patient mix and really rounding out a year of favorable patient mix. That last piece we don't see continuing to go forward to the same degree. But the products are performing very well for patients with PAH.
Importantly, in the quarter, we got approval for OPSYNVI, which is the first combination tablet of PDE5 and an ERA. This is in line with guidelines. It's really once a patient is diagnosed really the right first choice for them is to start them on combination therapy. And so we think that this is an important introduction. And as we take a look at our portfolio and even despite other new competitors that are coming in, we do believe with OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, they have got very strong usage and both with the launch of OPSYNVI as well as what we have, that these will continue to be really productive assets and a good therapeutic area for us.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.
Danielle Antalffy
Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. Tim, if I could just follow up on MedTech and specifically orthopedics and appreciate the onetime revenue recognition, not sure you can provide any color on exactly what changed there. But also, you talked about consistent MedTech growth going forward. I mean taking -- backing that out, you get to sort of 3% U.S. orthopedic sales growth. Is that the right way to think about that specific segment going forward or am I missing some onetime tailwinds, maybe talk a little bit about the outlook for ortho given what you guys put up this quarter? Thanks so much.
Timothy Schmid
Thank you, Danielle. Firstly, we are operating in a very robust market. As we communicated in the fourth quarter of last year, we still see some remnants of procedural backlog that are benefiting primarily our Orthopedics business, and we expect that to continue at least to the first half of 2024. As you mentioned, our overall performance in Orthopedics of 4.8% was impacted by a onetime change in revenue recognition timing. And this is only related to our U.S. business, but it did impact that business by about 300 basis points.
Now keep in mind, we also had the impact of the fewer selling days, which disproportionately impacted our ortho business by 80 bps. We are proud of the ongoing progress we're making, specifically in areas where we needed to compete better and specifically in hips and knees, we saw high single-digit growth in the first quarter and specifically in knees driven by the tremendous performance of our VELYS platform. We're now within two years in 18 markets, 50,000 procedures and are seeing that as a constant tailwind as we now expand the provision of VELYS into EMEA and Asia Pac through the remainder of the year. And so I think you can expect continued improvement in our Orthopedics business for the remainder of the year as we continue to build our portfolio and drive further expansion across the globe. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Charles Young
This is Charlie Yang for Geoff. I have two questions, please. I know there's recent news regarding the INVEGA SUSTENNA [indiscernible] litigation. Can you just tell us about kind of what we should kind of think about in terms of the potential kind of impact or in terms of the timing of the next steps? And then second, can you just talk about the TARIS bladder cancer data expectation at AUA. In terms of what kind of benchmark we should expect in terms of the 1-year CR rate? Thank you.
Jennifer L. Taubert
Perfect. I'll take the INVEGA SUSTENNA question, and I'll pass it over to my colleague, John to take the next one. So if we think about our LAI portfolio, our long-acting injectable just as a reminder for everybody, we really are leading therapies in this space with our INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA products. And we're really excited about the latest data that we have, particularly for HAFYERA, which a recent study shows that at two years, 96% patients on HAFYERA are relapse free, which is really, really striking.
So as we get to the legal question, we really don't speculate on the impact of ongoing litigation. But that being said, we remain really confident about the strength of our INVEGA SUSTENNA patents, and we're going to continue to defend the intellectual property that's associated with these patents. If we're clear to go a little bit deeper, the Federal Circuit’s April 1st decision did not invalidate our patent. It just remanded the case back to the New Jersey District Court, the one that had ruled in our favor originally. Likewise, there was another ruling and another case on this patent against a different company that also did go in our favor. So it's going back to the original judge that ruled in favor of the patents, and we'll have to see what comes. We don't speculate on that, but we remain really confident on the strength of our patents.
John C. Reed
Yes. Thanks for your interest in the platform that we have, the drug device combo for early bladder cancer. Clearly, a great unmet need and as much as there are more than 600,000 people every year who are diagnosed with early bladder cancer and the vast majority of those patients go on to have their bladders removed, which clearly has a very detrimental effect on quality of life. With our drug device system which I think, again, is a great example of how MedTech and pharma can come together in a synergistic way, but we delivered really, I think, exciting early data. Those were presented at the ESMO conference last September and showed, for example, with the TAR200 product that has gemcitabine, an impressive complete response rate of over 75% and nice durability with 21 out of 23 patients, we showed at that meeting is still ongoing and no patients having had to progress to a radical cystectomy. So I think at the AUA, because those data are not yet disclosed, I can't provide the details, but I think you can expect to see more of the same now with longer follow-up and with more patients. We've expanded those cohorts and do believe that we're on track to deliver pivotal data in that first indication, which is in the BCG nonresponsive patients recollect that in early bladder non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
Standard care is this attenuated micro bacteria BCG. Unfortunately, fewer than half patients receive -- achieve a complete response. And the therapy is -- has tolerability problems to say the least where patients feel like they have a chronic urinary tract infection. The discontinuation rate with TAR200 has been very low. So we're very delighted with the excellent tolerability profile as well as these impressive deep efficacy, deep and durable efficacy. So yes, so please watch that AUA presentation. I think we remain on track for a filing early next year based on these pivotal data, and we look forward to sharing those results at that congress.

Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.
Matthew Miksic
Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So a follow-up maybe on some of the device trends, in particular, cardio and EP very strong in the quarter. Wondering if you could provide some color kind of geographically as to how some of the product launches have either driven overseas or competitive environment in the U.S. has affected U.S. performance so far? And then just one quick one on Ortho, if I could.
Timothy Schmid
Sure, Matt. Firstly, let me start on cardio. As Joaquin mentioned, we've made a lot of progress in building out our portfolio. And until recently, we only participated in one high-growth category within cardiovascular and that being electrophysiology, which I will touch on performance in a second. We are and have had a 20-year lead in electrophysiology and now have built on that position in cardiovascular with the acquisition of Abiomed. We're now over a year into integrating that business and couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made. We continue to perform ahead of the deal model. And once again, this quarter did so with growth in excess of 15%. That gives us now two leadership positions within cardiovascular care. Once we close the acquisition of Shockwave, that will be our third very thoughtful and deliberate move to only participate in high-growth, high-margin cardiovascular areas where there is significant unmet need and tremendous opportunity for us to grow. And so we're very excited by the fact that we will be one of the only strategics with only high growth, high-margin businesses in the largest category within MedTech, $60 billion market, growing roughly 8%, incremental $5 billion of growth coming out of that category each and every year. So very excited by those moves.
Specifically, to your questions on EP, we've seen growth across the board in excess of 20%, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. And I think it really talks to the trust that our customers have in our technology today. RF and our portfolio of RF products are the most trusted and tested products with 20 years of experience. And by the way, we're not going to miss PFA, the progress we've made on ensuring that we can build our presence in that category with the approval in the EU as well as in Japan. We've also submitted for FDA approval. And while we don't control the timing, we expect that approval to come through by the end of this year or early next year. And so very confident in our ability to build on our leadership position in EP. Was there a specific question to Ortho?
Matthew Miksic
Just a comment on Ortho generally was sort of low to mid-single digits, but in hips and knees, sounded like 9%-ish, we added back the selling day and you're at double digits is just kind of really off the chart growth, I think, in that category. And I'm just wondering should we see like some sustainability of that rate or ramping down of that rate, how can you help us think about the rest of the year, in particular, in hips and knees?
Joseph J. Wolk
Well, Matt, I think it's a testament to the progress of our team but then also in building out our portfolio. We had some gaps in the past and now filling those gaps both in hips and then even more notably in knees with the launch of our VELYS robot is really what is creating the tailwind that we're enjoying today, and we do expect that to continue. Now this was a strong quarter. Can we see that sort of growth every single quarter, not absolutely sure, but we do expect high single-digit growth out of both of those categories going forward.
I will also say that the work we've done in the orthopedics areas hasn't been just about growth. It's also about improving our margin profile. And you know that in the second quarter of 2023, we announced a major restructuring, which is focused on really simplifying our portfolio and focusing our business on where we could drive the greatest impact for patients and for shareholders. That effort is resulting in a 20% reduction in our implants. And just to put that in context, we have 100,000 implants today within our orthopedics business. And so a real testament to the effort of group to not only drive top line performance but also evolve the portfolio to improve margins. Thank you again Matt.
Jessica Moore
Thanks, Matt. Kevin, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.
Vamil Divan
Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe if no one is after me I will just lead into it. One, I just was curious on SPRAVATO and sort of where like very strong growth again this quarter. If you can just provide a little more context there on where the growth is coming from, what sort of practices, what that the patients are given that product to be hopefully get a sense of that trend? And then just the other question we get a lot from investors is on the drug price negotiations with Medicare on the 10 drugs that are selected for this year's program through IRA. I know you probably won’t get too much into the specifics, but I'm curious if you can just share some high-level thoughts on how the progress of those discussions are going and is it sort of in line with what you expected, is there anything sort of very different from what you expected as the process plays out? Thank you.
Jennifer L. Taubert
Well, thanks for the question, and thanks for asking about SPRAVATO. We continue to be really pleased with the uptake of SPRAVATO as we continue to launch that product globally. You saw that there's over 70% growth in the quarter as it continues to perform well for patients with treatment-resistant depression. And so we've got a bold outlook for SPRAVATO as we continue to launch it into more markets and as we are able to even further penetrate the existing markets that we're in into a bit more of the community setting there.
In terms -- so good -- really, really good outlook. We're also just to put in a plug for neuroscience. We talk a lot about our oncology business and our immunology business. Neuroscience is also a key area for us, so SPRAVATO is a key platform. We've also got aticaprant and seltorexant coming, and we had mentioned the long-acting therapies with the INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise earlier.
So back on IRA, we've been really clear that we do think that these -- the IRA’s drug setting provisions are damaging to the health care innovative system. It just -- it is not something that is going to help reinforce the tremendous investments that we're making in R&D to develop the next types of treatments and cures. That being said, we do focus on patient access and are trying to make sure that our products are available to the patients who need them. And so we're working appropriately with the government and in line with the process to start going back and forth around what the ultimate price will be. So there has been a round or two of going back and forth. And so we're still in the middle of that process. I can't really provide any more details on that.
What I will say is that the products that we have that are going through the process, they are not our growth drivers for the future. Those are -- they are our products that are more at end of life. And so they're not the ones that are going to be really key for us both in the coming years as well as out through the end of the decade. And what I'd love to also reinforce is that we do remain confident that we've got a clear path to achieving our $57 billion commitment that we made back in December at our Enterprise Business Review as well as from 2025 to 2030, delivering above market growth with the 5% to 7% compounded annual growth rate and with growth in every year that being 2025 as well as all of the years beyond that. So irrespective of the IRA, when I take a look at our growth drivers and how our pipeline is coming in, we feel really confident about the state of our business.
Jessica Moore
Thank you, Vamil, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you, Jess, and Johnson & Johnson's solid first quarter performance reflects our sharpened focus and the progress in our portfolio and pipeline. Our impact across the full spectrum of health care is unique in our industry and the commercial, clinical, and capital allocation milestones achieved in Q1 reinforce our position as an innovation powerhouse. One of the most significant milestones this quarter was the announcement of our planned acquisition of Shockwave that will further strengthen our leadership position in cardiovascular. We continue to make strong progress towards the goals that we set out at our December Enterprise Business Review, and I'm looking forward to all that we will achieve through the remainder of 2024.

I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you, Jess and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for Johnson & Johnson in becoming a two sector company focused on innovative medicine at MedTech, we strengthened our position as an innovation powerhouse. We breakthrough science and transformative technology, we innovate across the entire patient pathway in ways no other company can.
And as we share at our Enterprise Business Review, we have a stronger growth margin profile and are more focused and agile than ever before, which is what you see with today's results. I'm particularly proud of our Q4 results with innovative medicine operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, growing by 9.5% at MedTech adjusted operational sales growing by an impressive 9.1%.
For the full year, we delivered strong and sustained performance with 9% operational sales growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine and 10.8% adjusted operational earnings per share growth. These results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our portfolio. And when I look at the milestones we achieved in 2023 and the promise of our pipeline, I have confidence in our guidance for 2024 and beyond.
So let's take a deeper look at the business and what we achieved last year. Starting with Innovative Medicine. For the full year, we delivered above-market operational sales growth of 7.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Our Innovative Medicine business continues to be fueled by growth from key brands and the acceleration of sales of new products. Our multiple myeloma portfolio is a good example with significant contribution from recently launched products including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY.
Turning to clinical trials. Key results from the year included positive Phase III readout for more than 10 of our in-line and pipeline medicines, including CARVYKTI, in one to three prior lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. DARZALEX in front-line multi myeloma transplant eligible patients. RYBREVANT, in combination with chemotherapy and RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer. And finally TREMFYA monotherapy in Ulcerative Colitis.
In addition, we saw positive Phase 1 and Phase 2 readout for nipocalimab and TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we initiated our Phase 3 clinical development programs for Milvexian and our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. Beyond that, we received FDA breakthrough designation for TAR-200 for the treatment of bladder cancer and fast track designations for Milvexian in Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Acute Coronary Syndrome.
And with 19 U.S. and EU filings across our Innovative Medicine business in 2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead. Our recent announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx to develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates further strengthens our oncology pipeline.
Now moving to MedTech. In 2023, we delivered full year operational sales growth of 12.4% and full year adjusted operational sales growth of 7.8%. For the first-time, our MedTech team delivered more than $30 billion in sales, as we continue to build a best-in-class business. We are accelerating growth through commercial execution, differentiated innovation and moving into higher growth markets, as you saw with our successful integration of Abiomed and our recent acquisition of Laminar, which focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
And at the same time, we are making strong progress in our pipeline, including advancing our Ottava surgical robot, MONARCH approval in China for bronchoscopy and continued market expansion for VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee replacement with CE Mark approval in 2023.
In electrophysiology, we have a lot of momentum in our post-field ablation portfolio. We announced regulatory approval a few weeks ago for the VARIPULSE PFA platform in Japan and have submitted for CE Mark approval in the EU. The true pulse generator has received approval in the EU and we received first and only approval from the U.S. FDA for a zero fluoroscopy workflow for cardiac ablation.
And in the fourth quarter, findings from our QDOT MICRO Catheter Q-FFICIENCY Study showed that very high power, short duration ablations improved quality of life and reduced health care utilization for atrial fibrillation patients. In Vision, we are driving strong performance across our TECNIS IOLs and OASYS 1-day family of contact lenses, including our most premium lens, ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, which has proven superiority in comfort and clarity versus the competition.
Turning to Abiomed. We recently completed our Impella ECP pivotal clinical trial. In Q4, we also enrolled our first patient in the Abiomed RECOVER IV randomized, controlled trial. As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business.
At our Enterprise Business Review, we shared that we expect our Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales.
In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for TREMFYA in IBD, ERLEADA in heavy (ph) stage prostate cancer, our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113 in psoriasis, Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy, guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804 in psoriatic arthritis, nipocalimab in Sjogren's Disease and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
In MedTech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect one-third of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we see strong progress towards these goals.
In electrophysiology that includes the full U.S. market release of QDOT MICRO Catheter and we are expecting CE Mark approval for our post-field ablation catheter VARIPULSE in Europe in the first half of 2024. We plan to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in the second half of 2024. And in Abiomed, we expect U.S. commercial launch of Impella RP Flex with smart assist and an Impella ECP submission in 2024. As you can see, our pipeline is advancing. Our business is transforming.
Before I turn the call to Jess and Joe, I want to thank our teams around the world for everything they do help our patients. We have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I'm confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jess.
Jessica Moore
Thanks, Joaquin. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted reflects the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.
Starting with Q4 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales increased 7.2%, with 11% in the U.S. and 2.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.7% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 2.1% outside the U.S. It is important to note that sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,500 basis points operationally.
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.70 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.22 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and the diluted earnings per share was $2.29, representing increases of 2.4% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.2%.
For the full year 2023, sales were $85.2 billion. Sales grew 7.4%, with 10.6% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 8.2% in the U.S. and 3.4% outside the U.S. Sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,000 basis points operationally.
Net earnings for the full year 2023 were $13.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $6.14 a year ago. Full year 2023 adjusted net earnings were $25.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.92, representing increases of 6.8% and 11.1%, respectively, versus full year 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 10.8%.
I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.7 billion increased 4% with growth of 9.5% in the U.S. and a decline of 3.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide and U.S. sales growth was 9.5%, and growth outside of the U.S. was 9.4%. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine were negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe.
Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 22.2% and 19%, respectively. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in both STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively. This growth was driven by market growth and share gains as well as favorable patient mix in TREMFYA. Growth of 17.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth.
Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in other Oncology. As a reminder, we expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures and a loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA, REMICADE and PREZISTA.
I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.7 billion increased 13.4% with Abiomed contributing 4.5% to growth. Growth in the U.S. was 14.1% and 12.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.1%. MedTech was negatively impacted by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 50 basis points, primarily in Advanced Surgery and Vision.
Electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.2% with strong growth in all regions, including Europe. This growth was driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OCTARAY catheters. Abiomed contributed $340 million in sales within the quarter driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology. Growth of 6.4% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by volume based procurement in China, primarily in Endocutters.
Orthopaedics growth of 5% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, as well as lapping of prior year China’s VBP price concessions in Spine. Growth of 6.6% in Vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS EYHANCE, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by U.S. stocking dynamics. Global Vision growth was negatively impacted by 140 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3.
Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin deleveraged by 130 basis points due to commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix in MedTech, partially offset by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit cost in Innovative Medicine. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $4.5 billion or 20.9% of sales this quarter. We invested $3.4 billion or 24.5% of sales in Innovative Medicine with the increase in investment being driven by higher milestones, partially offset by portfolio prioritization.
In MedTech, R&D investment was $1.1 billion or 14.6% of sales with the increase in investment primarily driven by the Laminar acquisition. Interest income was $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $77 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances and a lower average debt balance. The other income and expense line was income of $421 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $795 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized gains on securities and lower (ph) COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs.
Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% versus 16% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net decrease of tax liabilities, including the settlement of the 2013 through 2016 U.S. tax audit. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.8% versus 16.2% in the same period last year.
I encourage you to review our upcoming 2023 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.
Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 32.5% to 29.2%. Innovative Medicine margins declined from 37.7% to 37.4%, primarily driven by higher R&D milestones, partially offset by favorable patient mix and leveraging and selling and marketing expense.
MedTech margins declined from 24.5% to 15.5% primarily driven by in-process research and development expense from the Laminar acquisition, commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by selling and marketing expense leverage. This concludes the sale and earnings portion of the call.
I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.
Joseph Wolk
Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Joaquin and Jessica commented, 2023 was a strong year for Johnson & Johnson evidenced by notable top and bottom line performance beats relative to what we guided to 2023 at this time last year. We are particularly proud of the innovation we advanced to strengthen our development pipelines, the continued expansion of our portfolio and investments made for future success. All of this provides us with a strong foundation as we enter 2024.
Thus far during the call, you've heard about sales and income performance in 2023. So now let's dive into some detail on capital allocation highlights. We generated free cash flow of more than $18 billion in 2023. At the end of the year, we had approximately $23 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion.
We maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position, which enables us to strategically invest and deploy capital to unlock value. To that end, we executed against all of our capital allocation priorities in 2023.
For starters, we invested more than $15 billion in research and development or 17.7% of sales, an all-time high for the company as we remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. Jessica provided R&D investment by business segment, information we will continue to provide on a quarterly basis moving forward.
As far as dividends, 2023 marked the 61st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed over $3 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes the recent Ambrx and Laminar transactions as well as more than 50 smaller early-stage licensing deals and partnerships that complement our current Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines.
Finally, share repurchases. In early 2023, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program initiated in late 2022 and in combination with our dividend, returned over $14 billion to shareholders last year. Through the Kenvue separation, we further reduced the Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares or approximately 7% without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner.
Looking ahead to 2024, Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow generation should continue to solidify our already strong financial foundation and fuel further investment leading to growth for our business or returns to shareholders.
Now turning to our full year 2024 guidance. Today, we are confirming the 2024 guidance for those items previewed at our enterprise business review in early December by filling in some of the details. We expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5% to 6% or $88.2 billion to $89 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales.
In Innovative Medicine, we expect 2024 to deliver a 13th consecutive year of above market growth, driven by market share gains from key brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA as well as continued adoption of recently launched newer products such as CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, TALVEY and SPRAVATO.
In MedTech, we remain focused on executing our key value drivers: first, advancing our differentiated pipeline such as programs in pulse field ablation, Abiomed and surgical robotics, further shifting our portfolio into high-growth markets; second, expanding our reach and scale around the world; and third, building operational resilience across our portfolio.
We don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.09 as well as other major currencies, we estimate there would be a slight unfavorable impact of $400 million or a negative 0.5% on reported sales growth for the year.
Turning to other items on our P&L. We expect our 2024 adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points driven primarily by a continuation of efficiency programs across the organization. We expect this to be partially offset by anticipated STELARA biosimilar entrants in Europe in the second half of this year and some lingering inflation impact in MedTech inventory that will flow through 2024's P&L.
This margin improvement encompasses dilution of additional investment associated with our planned acquisition of Ambrx, which will be treated as a business combination. Now we do acknowledge that this 50 basis point improvement simply gets us back to what your models expected, given the elevated Q4 2023 R&D investment for new pipeline assets.
Regarding other income and expense, we anticipate income to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2024. This is less than the 2023 amount driven by the impact of actuarial assumptions on certain employee benefit programs such as lower discount rates. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest income between $450 million and $550 million, consistent with 2023 levels.
Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2024 in the range of 16% to 17% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. This tax rate takes into account an increase of approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points relative to the recently enacted Pillar 2 legislation. We continue to believe the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 is harmful, reducing U.S. incentives for innovation and resulting in U.S. based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments.
Our full year share count calculation for adjusted earnings per share in 2024 will include the remaining benefit equal to approximately 120 million shares from the approximately 191 million net share reduction in outstanding J&J shares following the Kenvue exchange offer. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 7.4% at the midpoint for a range of $10.55 to $10.75. Based on the euro spot rate of 1.09 from last week, we do not estimate any currency impact on earnings per share.
I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on quarterly phasing for your models. We expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe towards the middle of the year. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products.
We project MedTech operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year, expecting procedures in 2024 to remain above pre-COVID levels. The first half of the year will continue to have modest impact from Russia sanctions as our licenses are approved. We anticipate China VBP pricing for surgical IOLs and orthopedic sports to begin in 2024 with impacts from 2023 VBP in electrophysiology, Endocutters, Energy, Spine and Trauma to begin to anniversary throughout 2024.
Regarding EPS phasing, it is important to highlight that the first half of the year will benefit from the full 191 million net share reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer with only a partial comparative benefit in the third quarter versus Q3 2023 and the fourth quarter being neutral versus Q4 2023. So based on the foundation strengthened in 2023 and numerous catalysts that Joaquin outlined across our business in 2024, we are confident in our ability to achieve both near and long-term financial targets.
I'd like to close by thanking our colleagues for their dedication and commitment to benefit patients around the world. It is their effort that enables Johnson & Johnson to deliver innovative therapies and solutions that address serious unmet medical needs and creates long-term sustainable value for shareholders.
With that, I’m now pleased to turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A portion of the call.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live.
Joanne Wuensch
Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. With my one question, I'm curious why you're looking for 2024 procedure volumes to remain above pre-COVID levels and your expectations for how long that will last? Thank you.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remark the strong close of our MedTech business in 2023. We delivered annually more than $30 billion in sales, which is -- were all-time high in our company history with operational -- adjusted operational growth in the fourth quarter of 9.1. So very strong results across the board in electrophysiology, in heart (ph) recovery, in surgery, in orthopedics and in Vision. So when we think about our results in 2023, we think it's going to be aligned with our competitor composite for the year, but ahead of our competitor composite in the fourth quarter.
Now, certainly, COVID-19 impacts have stabilized globally and while we continue to see some challenges, macro challenges from the point of view of inflation, hospital staffing and the like, there is a bolus of patients coming out into the market after COVID-19, which has made 2023 market growth faster than historical averages. And we see that trend continuing into a good part of 2024 and therefore, being a tailwind into 2024. There's a lot of factors playing into that. But overall, we see the amended procedures continuing into at least the first half of 2024.
Now we also have a number of tailwinds on our side other than the procedures that make me optimistic about 2024. We have the trajectory of Abiomed in heart recovery, which is very strong with the adoption of Impella 5.5. We file already for our Impella ECP, which is the smaller version of Impella CP. In orthopedics, we continue to move into higher growth markets with the expansion of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We obtained CE Mark in Europe. In surgery, we continue to launch innovations across our surgery business with the [indiscernible], in Energy and ECHELON 3000 as a stapler. And we continue to see good expansion of our Plus Sutures too.
In our Vision business, we are expanding our TECNIS family into the premium segment of IOLs. And finally, and I know this is an area of interest to you in electrophysiology, we continue to expand our PFA portfolio of catheters. We obtained approval for our VARIPULSE, loop catheter, PFA loop catheter in Japan at the beginning of this year. And we continue to roll out the global launch of QDOT MICRO, our newest radio frequency ablation catheter. So overall, a number of catalysts and tailwinds into our MedTech business into 2024. As we discussed in our Enterprise Business Review, we continue to see our MedTech business growing at the upper end of our markets and becoming a best-in-class competitor in MedTech.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Terence Flynn
Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two-part for me on CARVYKTI. I noticed an ODAC panel was just announced to review the CARTITUDE-4 data. I was just wondering if you can talk about the focus of that upcoming meeting and your confidence in an on-time label expansion for CARTITUDE-4? And then the second part of the question is I know in manufacturing, you've been ramping up in Belgium, and I believe that facility is now up and running. So how should we think about supply for 2024 broadly for CARVYKTI? Thank you.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you, Terence. So with more than 2,000 patients treated CARVYKTI, it's already the fastest launch CAR-T in the market overall and we are pleased to continue to see quarter-over-quarter sequential growth in CARVYKTI. And overall, we remain confident in two things, both the risk benefit of CARVYKTI in the indication that is being studied and at the same on the potential of CARVYKTI to be $5 billion plus asset at peak year sales.
Regarding the ODAC that you commented, we are very confident on the data of our Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study that as a reminder, support the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines in treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We presented the results at ASCO, as you know. And we also published those results in the New England Journal of Medicine. And we very much look forward to review the updated survival and safety data with the FDA ODAC in the future.
We are committed to work with the FDA in the continued development of CARVYKTI. And we continue to have the focus on bringing this in immunotherapy to multiple myeloma patients in earlier lines of therapy. We are working with the FDA towards a PDUFA date for our CARTITUDE-4 indication in April 5, and with EMEA towards an anticipated CHMP opinion in the first quarter of 2024. So overall, we feel confident about the risk benefit profile in this indication and about the future of CARVYKTI.
Regarding your manufacturing question, we've done a significant progress in our manufacturing capacity, which is a major driver in the continuous growth of CARVYKTI. On the cell processing side, we have doubled our cell processing capacity in our Raritan facility. Since 2023. We are making progress to your point, Terence, in our European cell processing facilities. We are already manufacturing the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use this month of January. And we also have contracted additional capacity, external capacity to scale up production and increase our ability moving forward that will start mid this year.
On the other hand, we have also made significant progress in the internalization and scale-up of our lentivirus production. We have increased capacity in Switzerland, in our Switzerland side. And at the same time, we continue to progress with new U.S. capacity and additions site in the Netherlands to produce our lentivirus. Late December, we received approval to expand our lentivirus capacity from 20-liter tanks to 50-liter tanks of lentivirus production in our U.S. facility.
So overall, we feel good that we are progressing with CARVYKTI that we will continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth in 2024. And we are working towards building this $5 billion plus product and continue to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma, as we have discussed in the past, moving from treating to progression to treating to cure as we move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy.

Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.
Lawrence Biegelsen
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats to -- a nice finish to the year here. Joe or Joaquin, I'd love to hear just a general update on your M&A appetite and expand on your recent comments about Abiomed being a gateway in cardiovascular devices, which you, Joaquin, commented on earlier this month? Thanks so much for taking the question.
Joseph Wolk
Yeah. So Larry, let me start, good morning, and then I can turn it over to Joaquin. So we are very well positioned to continue to entertain many types of deals. As you know, we have the parameters of making sure that they are a strategic fit so that we've got scientific expertise and insights, a familiarity with the space has proven to be our most successful platforms.
We want to make sure that we're earning a fair return to compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. It was only 13 months ago, we were able to deploy $17 billion in capital for Abiomed. We're very pleased with that acquisition. Not only has it beat our internal deal models, but it also is performing better than what the Street had called for that business prior to the announcement of the acquisition. So it's been a really nice fit.
What I would say is, we also deployed or announced, as I said in my prepared remarks, over $3 billion in capital for more than 50 smaller licensing partnerships or deals. And while those may have not made headlines, they usually are headlines when they become products for patients. And so that when you think about our history of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, CARVYKTI for one, it's been -- that's kind of our track record. Our appetite is still, I would say, interested in moving into spaces that complement our existing portfolio, whether that be for the near or long term.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you. And look, talking about that, Larry, let me say, we are agnostic to sector and agnostic to size. And as Joe commented, our preference is clearly to be in areas in which we have internal capabilities and know-how, and also to go into products that represent a significant progress from the point of view of improving the current standard of care and that are first-in-class and best-in-class.
To illustrate that, the two deals that we completed this year, Laminar and Ambrx would be in that direction. So for example, Laminar is a deal in an area we know well, which is atrial fibrillation, and we believe could be first-in-class to be a device that can eliminate the left atrial appendage. When it comes to Ambrx, it's a deal in an area that we have a strong legacy like prostate cancer with a number of products marketed already. And this could be a first-in-class antibody drug conjugate in order to address a significant medical need in metastatic cut-resistant prostate cancer in patients that have failed under gene therapy.
So very much so and in that context, we continue to see also opportunities when it comes to Innovative Medicine in neuroscience and in immunology. And when it comes to MedTech, to your point, in other cardiology areas based on the strength that we have now with Biosense Webster and Abiomed and not excluding also the potential for other areas like robotic surgery or segments of orthopedics that are growing faster and also areas of Vision. So overall, that’s our approach. We try to put this strategic, scientific and to Joe’s point, scientific lens in order to be able to deliver value for patients and also value for our shareholders.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Chris Schott
Great. Thanks so much. Just, Joe a question for you. How should we think about gross margins in 2024 and beyond? I know you talked about operating margins, but it did seem like adjusted gross margins came down in 4Q. And I'm just wondering, if that's a one-off result or a longer-term trend when you think about -- as we think about kind of the cadence of your P&L over the next few years? Thank you.
Joseph Wolk
Yeah. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as you look at that specifically for the fourth quarter, what you have in our operating margins is obviously the Laminar transaction that was part of that mix. So on our slide that details IBT, you likely saw a quarterly reduction in MedTech, specifically of about 9 points, about 2 points for the full year. I would say two-thirds of that is represented by the Laminar transaction.
You also then have, I would say, in the fourth quarter specific some mix as orthopedics performed probably a little bit better than it had in previous quarters. And then you have the inflationary impact, obviously, with higher levels of inventory on our balance sheet that flow through the P&L, that is occurring throughout 2023. And we expect it to occur throughout at least the first half of 2024.
We're not seeing any incremental inflation in, I'll call it, current activity. So it's not being additive to inventory, but it's also not subsiding either. So we're kind of at a new, I'd say water level, if you will, that should be going forward, but not hurting the P&L as we look out beyond the second half of 2024.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Shagun Singh
Great. Thank you so much. I was just wondering, if we could get your latest thoughts on the potential impact of Novo's osteoarthritis data on orthopedic utilization, given the focus on WOMAC or pain scores. I believe the presentation could be here soon. Just curious to hear your thoughts and also what kind of scores could or may not have a potential impact? Thank you for taking the question.
Joaquin Duato
So overall, look, osteoarthritis is a contributor to knee surgery. Sometimes I'm asked about osteoarthritis in the context of the GLP-1s, and weight is not a factor in osteoarthritis. We continue to look at this data, and it's early for us to give you an answer there. Now what we can tell you is that we continue to see an increased volume of procedures in orthopedics based on coming out of COVID. And we don't see any change in that neither in the hips or in the knee area or in any of the segments that we compete.
So we are optimistic about our orthopedics trajectory. Specifically we are optimistic about how we are progressing with our VELYS robotic system for total knee replacement. We have already have 30,000 procedures with very positive feedback from the surgeons, especially in the ambulatory surgical centers. We are working to submit our 510(k) for our VELYS unique knee application. And we are seeing a strong recovery also in our hip business with a combination of new products like ACTIS, KINCISE and VELYS hip navigation.
So we feel good about our orthopedics business as we continue to see global procedure recovery in most markets. We continue to succeed with our new products, and we love also part of the headwind that we had in China during this year. So very positive outlook moving forward for our orthopedics business.
Joseph Wolk
And Shagun, it's also important to maybe provide us a reminder what we commented to last quarter, and that's -- we're looking very hard at improving the profitability of the orthopedics unit, so being very selective as to what geographies we play in and what SKUs are actually going to be offered. So not only will you see some of the strength in the top line, as Joaquin outlined, but you should see an improved margin profile for that business as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.
Vamil Divan
Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.. So just maybe an area we don't spend as much time on is on the respiratory side, specifically, PAH. But just sort of a two-part question, but that franchise of yours continue to sort of outperform expectations. So curious, if you can talk about sort of what's driving success there? There's also an area where you don't have a lot of sort of longer-term investment. So going back to sort of the business development question, I'm just curious in your interest in sort of PAH or respiratory more generally as an area, further focus given your key franchises are going to be going away, but you do have the infrastructure there already?
Joaquin Duato
So first, let me underline the great results of our PAH franchise in 2023. We had growth in the high-teens driven by improved patient mix, market growth coming out of COVID too. This was an area that was heavily impacted by COVID as pulmonologists were working at COVID and not diagnosing new patients. So overall, it's been a very positive trajectory of our PAH business, and we remain confident about the short-term future of this business into 2024.
We are working towards the combination of macitentan, OPSUMIT with Tadalafil, which the trademark will be OPSYNVI. And that would be another option for patients there to enhance compliance. And in my talks with physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, they seem very positive about it, and we expect an approval of that combination in 2024. So that's the outlook for our pulmonary franchise.
Are we looking at other areas there? There, we are looking at the space and see if there are potential opportunities to be able to improve the standard of care. And we continue to look to see how we can continue to extend the success of our pulmonary franchise into the future. But overall, we're very happy with the trajectory of our pulmonary franchise in 2023. And we expect a similar trajectory as macitentan, OPSUMIT and Tadalafil (ph) become standard of care clearly established in this area.

Thank you. Next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.
Louise Chen
Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. I just wanted to ask you with respect to your oncology franchise. Do you have any thoughts on CAR-Ts for autoimmune disease at all? And then secondly, radiopharmaceutical?
Joaquin Duato
So thank you, Louise and we have a strong oncology franchise in different areas. I commented that here in prostate cancer with ERLEADA that I discussed before. We'll see data in high risk localized prostate cancer in 2024 with the addition of Ambrx now and antibody drug conjugate in this area. We are very, very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. We have Phase 3 studies completed. We expect -- we have filed all the three indications, and we expect approval of that in 2024. So we are very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer in first line.
Moving into bladder cancer. You also will see data with TARIS-200, and TARIS-210 in non-muscle invasive localized bladder cancer. And we received FDA breakthrough designation for TARIS-200 in 2023. And then we continue our progress in our multiple myeloma franchise. We talk about CARVYKTI, but it's important to recognize how well [Technical Difficulty] with the impressive per sales data that we presented in first-line in newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients. So we are looking at CAR-T in autoimmune diseases to your question, yes, but it's early data.
As you know, we did a deal earlier in 2023 to partner two CAR-Ts, a CD19 and a CD19/CD20 BiCAR. So we are looking at that, and it's early data. It looks promising. We are interested in radiopharmaceuticals. We believe that the avenue that we are doing with antibody drug conjugates, it's an important therapeutic option. And when it comes to radiopharmaceuticals, we did a deal earlier this year with Nanobiotics for a radio enhancer that this still been developing head and neck cancer.
We expanded our rights at the end of the year. And this could be another avenue to be there for us in which we could combine our expertise in medical devices, in medical technology and pharmaceuticals. And we plan to do a broader development plan of our radio enhancing, and we’ll provide you more information about it as we continue to move. So overall, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in our oncology franchise, both in solid tumors and in hematology. And it remains a core strength of our Innovative Medicine group.

Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.
Matt Miksic
Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about MedTech trends and margins. And I think you mentioned some of the headwinds there were patient mix. Would love to get an idea of maybe kind of in the middle of the P&L and the operating line in terms of margin progression throughout the year, which ones of those of your business lines being kind of more reflecting that negative mix that you described and how that progresses during the year? Thanks.
Joseph Wolk
Yeah, Matt. I apologize, but it was a little bit tough to hear your question entirely. I think it was around margins, specifically in MedTech and how that may progress through the year. So as I stated earlier, I would say that the margin profile is going to be impacted by inflationary pressures that were incurred really in 2022, sit on our balance sheet as inventory and then kind of flow through the P&L throughout the corresponding 2023 and probably a good piece of 2024.
That being said, Tim and the team are doing magnificent work in terms of finding efficiencies across the business. I highlighted one of the earlier ones with respect to orthopedics. But we're quite frankly doing that across the entire MedTech portfolio at this point in time, looking for opportunities whether it be aided by artificial intelligence or just infrastructure overall as to how we can further improve the MedTech profitability profile. Right now, we stand a little bit above the middle of the pack in terms of our peer set on margin, and we're looking to get towards the upper end of that peer set.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Geoff Meacham
Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just wanted to ask you about the XARELTO patient mix that you guys called out. Just help us with kind of current dynamics and maybe looking forward whether this trend you expect to continue? Thank you.
Jessica Moore
Yeah, Geoff. I can answer that one. So specifically on XARELTO in the quarter, we would say there's two items. It's patient mix, but there is also a one-time entry. Moving forward in 2024, we do expect that there will be a decline but not to the extent that you saw in Q4.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.
Danielle Antalffy
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Joe, sorry to harp on the MedTech margin side of things. I appreciate everything you're saying for going forward. But just as we look at Q4 specifically, even adding back Laminar, we're still getting to sort of down 400 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. And I was just hoping maybe you could bridge us a little bit more. Is there any component of that is sort of price increases taken in late '22 into '23 rolling off or anything that you would highlight there? Thanks so much.
Joseph Wolk
No, Danielle. I think it's really the inflationary impact, so out of the 9% drop that you saw in Q4, 5 points are really Laminar. The other -- the balance of 4 points, I would chalk up to the inflationary impact that I spoke of earlier and then the mix component, whereby orthopedics, which is our lowest margin portfolio within the MedTech portfolio overall, performed a little bit better. So there's really nothing magical behind it other than the explanations that were already given on the call.
Again, we are looking at cost improvement initiatives, specifically in orthopedics, but across the entire portfolio as we move through 2024. But there’s nothing that happened – maybe this is the best way to state it. There’s nothing that happened in Q4 that has us concerned about our outlook or calls around margin profile or EPS for the balance of this upcoming year.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live.
David Risinger
Yes. Thanks very much and thanks for all of the details today. So notwithstanding the recently announced Ambrx acquisition, in recent years, J&J has executed more MedTech M&A than pharma M&A. And I don't mean to belabor the point, I know that you got some specific therapeutic area questions. But could you just comment at a high level on what has held J&J back in pharma M&A in recent years and whether we should expect greater cash deployment to accelerate long-term pharma revenue growth going forward? Thank you.
Joaquin Duato
So thank you, David. And M&A has been -- M&A and external innovation has been a core of our pharma portfolio growth and transformation. As I said initially, we are agnostic to sector. In the case of pharma, our preferred mode has been trying to go to assets that were around proof of concept. So generally speaking, from a size perspective, it's been about deals that have been either of a smaller size or have been different modalities like client senses or partnerships.
Just last year, we completed overall at Johnson & Johnson more than 50 deals. The thing is that the headlines are only made by the ones that are M&A. So we've done multiple deals in our pharmaceutical side in order to be able to enhance our existing portfolio. And our bias is to go for transactions that are going to enable us to create more value by leveraging our clinical development strength, our manufacturing capabilities and our commercial reach. So hence, why the majority of the deals that you see in our pharmaceutical side are at an earlier stage.
Are we looking broader than that? Yes, we do. But mainly, we find more opportunities to create value at an earlier stage. For example, this year, we did a number of deals that went less publicized. We did, as I commented before, a deal with CNBG now called AbelZeta (ph) in CAR-T with CD19 and CD20, which we believe could be a best-in-class CAR-T in this area that could launch in this decade or at the end of the year, we also did another deal in antibody drug conjugates with a Korean company called LegoChem, which was underreported.
But we continue to work in identifying deals in our pharmaceutical space that enables us to be able to put all our capabilities to work in the clinical development side, in manufacturing and in commercial. And that’s been the source of very significant value creation in products that all of you know, like DARZALEX or CARVYKTI that come from that type of approach of going earlier on into the development process.
Jessica Moore
Thank you, David. We have time for one last question.
Operator
Our final question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel.
Frederick Wise
All right. Good morning. Thanks you. Maybe you could expand a little bit more on your electrophysiology comments. You had an extraordinary quarter. I'm guessing the new products helped. Maybe you could give us a little more color on maybe quantify the impact -- the negative impact from China VBP? And looking ahead, we've got not -- we've got one PFA device approved in U.S., another one seemingly coming in the next month or three maybe. How should we think about the EP franchise as we look ahead to '24? What are you incorporating in your thinking? Thank you so much.
Joaquin Duato
So thank you for the question. Great, and strong results of our EP franchise in 2023. And you should think about our EP franchise in 2024 as also a strong year, another year of growth, a strong growth for our EP franchise. If I look at the -- to your point that the drivers of growth in 2023, it was across the board. I mean it was in Asia-Pacific, in the U.S. and EMEA. It was driven by the procedure recovery, but also by new product performance and some offset also, a slight offset of value-based procurement in China.
The new products that we introduced this year are the engine generator, our mapping catheters OCTARAY and OPTRELL. And also, importantly, our QDOT MICRO Catheter in radio frequency ablation that has efficacy results higher than any PFA catheter. And that together with our strong commercial execution and broad clinical support across the board has driven this result in electrophysiology that in the fourth quarter was 25% growth globally, 22% growth in the U.S. and 29% outside of the U.S. So very strong results.
So we have a strong leadership in electrophysiology and 20 years of understanding this field. And when it comes to our strategy in cardiac ablation, we have multiple strategies, but one core strategy is our CARTO mapping system. That is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow.
For the electrophysiologist, it's very important to know where they are and what are they doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system. And the CARTO system, it's providing the electrophysiologist real-time feedback and very important parameters like tissue proximity, contact force measurement and ablation indexes that give them an idea of how durable deletion is going to be and what are going to be the outcomes of the procedures.
So that's key for us to be able to have a workflow that enables the type of progress that electrophysiologists have been already used to with radio frequency ablation. And hence, all our suite of catheters, it's is going to be from day 1 fully integrated in our mapping system. We have 5,000 CARTO systems already deployed globally and an extensive network of mappers to support the electrophysiologist. When it comes to our catheters, we are developing a full portfolio of options. You commented on VARIPULSE, our multi-electrode catheter that was approved in Japan.
We are developing a focal and a large focal catheter and also a single shot one. So electrophysiologists are going to be able to choose the catheter that is more appropriate for their anatomy and for the workflow that they are selecting. We have five clinical trials active, three of them have completed. And we have submitted our VARIPULSE catheter for CE Mark and we plan submitting the VARIPULSE catheter to the U.S. FDA in 2024.
Ultimately, PFA is an important option, but RF is also here to stay. That's why we believe that having the workflow and the procedure efficiency that CARTO gives you plus the option of having a catheter like our dual energy catheter that would enable electrophysiologists to simply change depending on the anatomy of deletion from PFA to RFA, it's going to be important for the future. And it's going to help them adopting PFA as this is the most widely used catheter in the world.
So very positive about our growth in 2024 based on the strength that we have in this area. I'm positive about the outlook of our ablation business moving forward. As we have commented in multiple occasions, atrial fibrillation, it's an area that is still undertreated. And the outcomes of radio frequency ablation and most likely, the outcomes of PFA have shown significant improvement even compared to medical therapy. So very positive about the outlook of our -- and the strength of our atrial fibrillation business.
Jessica Moore
Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn’t get to because of time, but don’t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.

Thank you, Jess. The strong performance we delivered in ‘23 gives me great confidence in the trajectory of our business. As I said earlier, we are entering 2024 from a position of strength, and we have multiple catalysts for growth. No other company is as well positioned as Johnson & Johnson to lead the next wave of health care innovation. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the year ahead. Thank you.
