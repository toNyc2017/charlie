Strategic risk factors include the potential for unsuccessful execution of business strategies due to macroeconomic changes, geopolitical tensions, and political risks. The macroeconomic environment can significantly impact financial markets, interest rates, and asset returns, affecting Manulife's financial results and ability to implement its business strategy. Changes in customer behavior and claims emergence due to economic conditions can also impact the company's operations.

Reputation risk can arise from adverse publicity, litigation, or regulatory action related to business practices or actions by employees, representatives, or business partners. Manulife's reputation is crucial and can be affected by the actions of third parties, including affiliated broker-dealers, agents, and business partners.

Regulatory changes can impact profitability and growth. Manulife's operations are subject to extensive regulation, and changes in laws or their interpretation can increase compliance costs and affect financial results. Future regulatory capital, actuarial, and accounting changes could also have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and competitive position.

3. **Execution**: Processes for risk identification, measurement, assessment, and mitigation.
4. **Evaluation**: Validation and oversight to ensure the company’s risk profile aligns with its desired risk levels.

Manulife employs a "three lines of defense" model for risk governance:
- **First Line**: Business operations personnel, including the CEO and Segment General Managers, are responsible for managing risks.
- **Second Line**: Independent oversight by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Chief Compliance Officer, and Chief Actuary.
- **Third Line**: Audit Services providing independent assurance on the effectiveness of controls and risk management processes.

Strategic risks include the potential failure to execute business strategies effectively, influenced by the global macroeconomic environment, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory changes. The macroeconomic environment can significantly impact financial markets, interest rates, and asset returns, affecting Manulife's financial results and ability to implement its business strategy. Specific changes in the macroeconomic environment, such as rising interest rates or geopolitical tensions, can have varied impacts across different parts of the business.

Regulatory changes pose significant risks, with Manulife's operations subject to extensive regulation across multiple jurisdictions. Changes in laws, regulations, or their interpretation can increase compliance costs and affect profitability. For example, OSFI's new Parental Stand-alone (Solo) Capital Framework and the NAIC's group capital calculation could impact capital requirements. Additionally, global financial regulators are increasingly focusing on climate change, requiring firms to establish climate transition plans and enhance risk management and governance structures.

Tax law changes also present risks, potentially making some products less attractive and increasing corporate taxes. The OECD's two-pillar solution for international tax challenges and Canada's proposed tax changes could affect Manulife's effective tax rate and financial results.

Access to capital may be impacted by market conditions, and as a holding company, MFC relies on its subsidiaries for cash flow. Regulatory requirements and macroeconomic conditions can affect subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, potentially limiting MFC's financial flexibility.

Overall, Manulife's risk management strategies aim to safeguard commitments to stakeholders, maintain financial strength, and adapt to evolving regulatory and market conditions, while pursuing prudent risk-taking aligned with the company's strategic objectives.

Foreign currency exchange risk is managed by matching the currency of assets with liabilities and hedging mismatches. Liquidity risk is addressed through diversified business operations, product design to encourage policy retention, and maintaining a large portion of liquid assets.

Manulife's variable annuity dynamic hedging strategy involves using various derivative instruments to offset changes in the value of variable annuity guarantees. However, it does not completely hedge all risks, such as policyholder behavior and mortality experience. The macro equity risk hedging program aims to maintain earnings sensitivity within approved limits by addressing residual equity exposure from various sources.

The company's asset liability management strategy involves aligning asset strategies with product liabilities to optimize returns while considering regulatory and economic capital requirements. Products with guaranteed cash flows are managed to achieve target returns, while pass-through products use a total return strategy combining fixed income with ALDA and public equity investments.

**Credit Risk Factors**:
Credit risk factors include borrower or counterparty defaults and downgrades, which could lead to increased impairments and allowances. As of December 31, 2023, the largest single counterparty exposure was $1,357 million, with net exposure after collateral being nil. The total maximum credit exposure related to derivatives was $9,044 million, reduced to $154 million after netting agreements and collateral.

Overall, Manulife's risk management strategies are designed to mitigate various risks while optimizing returns and maintaining regulatory capital requirements. The company employs a comprehensive approach to managing market, credit, and product risks, ensuring alignment with its strategic objectives and risk appetite.           Manulife's product risk management is overseen by the Product Oversight Committee for insurance and the Global WAM Risk Management Committee for wealth and asset management. These committees ensure that products align with the company's risk appetite and profit targets. The insurance business employs a global underwriting manual and retention limits to manage large claims, with a current global life retention limit of US$30 million per individual policy. The company reinsures exposures exceeding these limits and actively manages aggregate risks.

Product risk factors include potential losses from deviations in actual experience versus assumptions used in valuing insurance contract liabilities. Policyholder behavior, influenced by economic conditions and market alternatives, can also impact profitability. Regulatory challenges may delay or prevent price increases on in-force business, particularly in the U.S. long-term care market. Evolving genetic testing legislation could lead to anti-selection risks if insurers are restricted from accessing genetic test results.

Catastrophic events, changes in disease prevalence, medical advancements, and lifestyle changes can unpredictably affect life and health insurance claims. The cost of health insurance benefits may rise due to unforeseen trends in claims incidence and severity. Advances in medical technology could increase life expectancy, impacting the ultimate level of lifetime benefits paid.

External market conditions affect the availability, terms, and cost of reinsurance, which is crucial for Manulife's risk and capital management strategy. Changes in the reinsurance industry could lead to increased rates on existing contracts, impacting earnings and the cost of reinsurance.

Overall, Manulife's approach to managing product risk involves rigorous oversight, regular experience monitoring, and strategic use of reinsurance to mitigate potential financial impacts.           Manulife's operational risk management encompasses a broad range of risks, including regulatory compliance failures, technology failures, and business interruptions. The company's strategy includes robust corporate governance, internal controls, and an enterprise-wide risk management framework. An Operational Risk Committee oversees these risks, supported by Global Compliance, which monitors regulatory compliance and emerging legal issues.

Manulife's business continuity strategy ensures operations can continue during disruptions, with detailed plans and regular testing.

As of December 31, 2023, the company held $250.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. The company also has contingent liquidity sources, including credit facilities and the ability to obtain loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.

Credit risk is managed through a comprehensive program overseen by the Credit Committee, which sets exposure limits and evaluates credit proposals. The company uses an Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model to establish allowances on invested assets, which are monitored and adjusted regularly.

Product risk is managed by the Product Oversight Committee and Global WAM Risk Management Committee, which ensure products align with risk appetite and profit objectives. The company monitors policyholder behavior and claims experience to update insurance contract liabilities as needed.

Manulife's hedging strategies aim to mitigate market risks, but they come with additional risks such as counterparty risk and the complexity of the strategies. The company also faces risks from prolonged low or high interest rates, which can impact investment returns, policyholder behavior, and capital ratios.

Overall, Manulife's risk management strategies are designed to identify, measure, and mitigate risks across various domains, ensuring the company's stability and resilience in the face of potential disruptions and market changes.           Manulife faces several key risks and challenges that could impact its financial performance and operational stability.

This could impact financial performance if premium rates cannot be adjusted to offset increased reinsurance costs.

**Product Risk**: Assumptions related to claims, policyholder behavior, expenses, and sales levels are critical. Deviations from these assumptions could lead to significant losses. Manulife's Product Oversight Committee and Global WAM Risk Management Committee oversee product risk management.

**Genetic Testing Legislation**: Evolving legislation on genetic testing could impact underwriting abilities, leading to anti-selection and increased claims.

**Catastrophic Events**: Natural disasters, pandemics, and large-scale human-made disasters could cause substantial volatility in financial results and impact profitability.

**Reinsurance Market Conditions**: Availability, terms, and cost of reinsurance protection are influenced by external market conditions, affecting Manulife's financial position and ability to write new policies.

The interconnectedness of Manulife's operations and risk management strategies could expose the company to risks if not appropriately considered and communicated. The company acknowledges that its risk management policies and strategies may not be comprehensive, and future behavior may differ from past behavior.

Manulife is also subject to tax audits and litigation, which could result in additional taxes, interest, and penalties.

Strategic Highlights

We are delivering against our strategy to optimize our portfolio

In the first quarter, we closed a milestone reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic on four in-force blocks of legacy/low ROE business, including the largest LTC reinsurance deal in history. We have commenced a share buyback program to return capital released from this transaction to our shareholders.
In Canada, we entered into the largest universal life reinsurance agreement of its kind. The transaction, which closed on April 2, 2024, transferred $5.6 billion of insurance contract net liabilities to RGA Canada 7. The expected capital release of $0.8 billion represents an attractive 16.2 times earnings multiple and will be returned to shareholders through an ordinary share repurchase program. 8

In Asia, we continued to roll out our top-tier recognition and activation program, Manulife Pro, across the region with the recent expansion to Indonesia and Japan. The program provides selected agents with differentiated resources and tools, including dedicated underwriting support and enhanced customer engagement services with access to customer leads.
In Global WAM, we announced the closing of a $1.0 billion institutional fund - Manulife Capital Partners VII. The fund will invest in U.S. middle market companies across multiple industries, focusing on growth and high-yield opportunities.

In addition, we partnered with the Indonesia Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund to raise and manage funds for investment. The partnership involves co-investments between the sovereign wealth fund, Manulife, and third-party investors in Indonesian infrastructure, real estate, and the natural capital sectors, which include timberland and agriculture assets.

We are enhancing our digital leadership, delivering better customer experience and superior distribution capabilities

In Asia, we completed the roll-out of M-Pro, a first-in-market digital pre-issuance verification tool, to all distribution channels in Vietnam. M-Pro has further improved customer experience and we have received outstanding

feedback on the ease of navigating policy issuance details, ability to review crucial policy information and transparency of the consultation process.

In the U.S., we accelerated our distribution team’s ability to act on sales opportunities and improved their efficiency in assisting agents by implementing JHINI – our new, AI-powered, sales enablement tool.

In addition, we streamlined our underwriting process and improved our John Hancock customers’ experience by expanding our usage of electronic health records and leveraging other types of underwriting evidence, which have allowed us to eliminate certain medical test requirements for all ages and face amounts.
In Global WAM, we completed the implementation of a new advisor retail wealth platform in Canada as part of our digital transformation strategy, representing more than $54 billion in AUMA, by leveraging an industry leading technology platform. The platform delivers an enhanced advisor and client experience and enables advisors to streamline their processes.

We are helping our customers live longer, healthier, and better lives

In Canada, we entered into a multi-year loyalty rewards partnership agreement with Aeroplan. Beginning in early summer 2024, eligible Manulife group benefits members will be able to earn rewards points using our group benefits digital platforms by engaging in behaviours and activities that encourage health and well-being.
In the U.S., we drove a 43% improvement compared with 1Q23 in the number of visits to the Vitality page of JohnHancock.com supported by the launch of Your Year in Wellness – our first social-sharing campaign to raise awareness about the value of John Hancock Vitality.

Delivered strong core earnings growth, while net income reflected the impact of the GA Reinsurance Transaction with largely neutral impact to book value9

Core earnings of $1.8 billion in 1Q24, up 16% from 1Q23
Core earnings of $1.8 billion in 1Q24, up 16% from 1Q23

The 16% year-over-year increase in core earnings reflects strong business growth across our insurance businesses and higher fee income in Global WAM benefitting from favourable market impacts and positive net flows. Core earnings increased 39% in Asia and 25% in Global WAM compared with 1Q23. The provision for expected credit loss was a modest net release in 1Q24 compared with a net charge in 1Q23, reflecting a benign credit experience this quarter. Updates to actuarial methods and assumptions in the second half of 2023 also contributed to core earnings growth. These were partially offset by modestly more adverse insurance experience, and higher workforce-related costs primarily reflecting strong TSR 10 performance. The net impact of the GA Reinsurance Transaction on core earnings was a $18 million charge in 1Q24.

Net Income attributed to shareholders of $0.9 billion in 1Q24, $0.5 billion lower compared with 1Q23
The $0.5 billion decrease in net income reflects the $0.8 billion impact from the GA Reinsurance Transaction, partially offset by core earnings growth. Most of the GA Reinsurance Transaction impact is from the sale of debt instruments related to the transaction, which, is broadly offset by an associated change in Other Comprehensive Income resulting in a neutral impact to book value. This, along with lower-than-expected returns on alternative long-duration assets and higher-than-expected returns on public equity, resulted in a $0.8 billion market experience loss in 1Q24. The overall book value per common share increased 5% compared with 1Q23.

Record levels of new insurance business results and strong net inflows in Global WAM

Continued momentum in our 1Q24 new business results with year-over-year growth across all insurance segments, resulting in increases of 21%, 52% and 34% in APE sales, new business CSM and NBV, respectively
In Asia, APE sales increased 13% from 1Q23, driven by growth in Asia Other and Japan, partially offset by lower sales in Hong Kong. Business mix and the impact of updates to actuarial methods and assumptions in the prior year further contributed to a 68% growth in new business CSM. NBV also increased 28% compared with 1Q23. The improvement in NBV margin was driven by our pricing discipline and changes in business mix.

Canada generated 54% growth in APE sales, driven by higher sales volumes in all business units, led by



large-case Group Insurance sales. Combined with margin expansion in our insurance businesses, NBV and new business CSM increased 71% and 52%, respectively. In the U.S., APE sales increased 14%, reflecting an increase in demand from affluent customers for accumulation insurance products. Combined with product mix, this led to a 3% and 9% increase in new business CSM and NBV, respectively.

Global WAM net inflows of $6.7 billion in 1Q24, increased $2.3 billion compared with $4.4 billion in 1Q23

Retirement net inflows of $3.2 billion in 1Q24 increased from $1.2 billion in 1Q23, reflecting higher new

retirement plan sales across our three geographies.

Retail net inflows of $1.7 billion in 1Q24 increased from $0.8 billion in 1Q23, driven by increased demand



for investment products amid equity market recovery and improved investor sentiment. Institutional Asset Management net inflows of $1.8 billion in 1Q24 decreased compared with $2.5 billion in 1Q23 as higher fixed income mandates sales and lower money market redemptions were more than offset by higher redemptions in fixed income and equity mandates.

Increase in CSM balance driven by organic CSM growth and favourable impact of markets

CSM net of NCI11 was $21,089 million as at March 31, 2024
CSM net of NCI11 was $21,089 million as at March 31, 2024

CSM net of NCI increased $649 million compared with December 31, 2023. Organic CSM movement was an increase of $314 million in 1Q24, primarily driven by the impact of new business and interest accretion, partially offset by amortization recognized in core earnings. Insurance experience improved both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Inorganic CSM movement was an increase of $335 million for the same period, primarily driven by the favourable impacts of equity market performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the impact of the GA Reinsurance Transaction. Post-tax CSM net of NCI1 was $18,547 million as at March 31, 2024.

The Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. We use a number of non-GAAP and other financial measures to evaluate overall performance and to assess each of our businesses. This section includes information required by National Instrument 52-112 – Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure in respect of “specified financial measures” (as defined therein).
Non-GAAP financial measures include core earnings (loss); core earnings available to common shareholders; net income excluding the impact of the GA Reinsurance Transaction; common shareholders’ net income excluding the GA Reinsurance Transaction; core earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“core EBITDA”); core revenue; adjusted book value; post-tax contractual service margin; and post-tax contractual service margin net of NCI (“post-tax CSM net of NCI”). In addition, non-GAAP financial measures include the following stated on a constant exchange rate (“CER”) basis: any of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures; net income attributed to shareholders; and common shareholders’ net income.
Non-GAAP ratios include core return on common shareholders’ equity (“core ROE”); return on common shareholders’ equity (“ROE”) excluding the impact of the GA Reinsurance Transaction; diluted core earnings per common share (“core EPS”); diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) excluding the impact of the GA Reinsurance Transaction; adjusted book value per common share; financial leverage ratio; core EBITDA margin; and percentage growth/decline on a constant exchange rate basis in any of the above non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios; net income attributed to shareholders; diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”); and new business CSM.
Other specified financial measures include NBV; APE sales; gross flows; net flows; average assets under management and administration (“average AUMA”); and percentage growth/decline in these foregoing specified financial measures. In addition, explanations of the components of the CSM movement, other than the new business CSM were provided in the 1Q24 MD&A.

Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios are not standardized financial measures under GAAP and, therefore, might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. Therefore, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any other financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, including those referred to above, see the section “Non-GAAP and other financial measures” in our 1Q24 MD&A, which is incorporated by reference.
