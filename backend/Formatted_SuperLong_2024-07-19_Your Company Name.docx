Company Origin
·In the 1960s, health-policy pioneer Dr. Paul Ellwood developed the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) to make healthcare more affordable.  Congress approved this model in 1970 and many sought to commercialize this product.
· Founded by Richard Burke in 1974 and reorganized as UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) to manage early HMOs in Minnesota.
· The company bought many HMOs in other markets throughout the 80s and 90s.  In 1998 the company was reorganized as a holding company of its independent subsidiaries cementing its business model as an owner of health insurance plans throughout the US.
· In 2003, UNH began operating its pharmacy benefits management business under a division that is now called Optum.
· Currently, the company is headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota and manages HMOs, Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), and a variety of products that make healthcare more affordable.  Its CEO is Andrew Witty, former CEO of GSK (2008-2017), who succeeded former Stephen Helmsley who held the CEO position for 10 years and now is the Exec.

- PANW can create synergies for customers who can use all 3 of their product lines in tandem to optimize their cybersecurity ecosystem. 
- As the most comprehensive provider, PANW experiences economies of scale as the data packets its products interpret can be leveraged into improved products in the next generation.



How:
 Corporate Governance:
- Leadership:
o CEO: Nikesh Arora has held the position since 6/1/2018 and has led the company during a period of significant growth.  Prior to PANW, Arora was an executive at Deutsche Telekom from 2000-2004 where he established the T-Motion division which was integrated into T-Mobile’s core services.  Following his time at Deutsche, Arora was SVP and Chief Business Officer (CBO) at Google (2011-2014) and President and COO at Softbank (2015-2016).
o Nir Zuk: Founder Nir Zuk remains on as CTO and is credited with commercializing the first NGFW.  Previously, Zuk was principal engineer at Check Point and CTO at NetScreen Technologies which was acquired by Juniper in 2004.  When Zuk presented the concept that came to known as the NGFW to Juniper, he was turned down and left to start PANW.
o Other Management Team Highlights: Former President and CEO of Barracuda Networks (through IPO) BJ Jenkins is President of PANW.  CBO Amit Singh is credited with founding and building Google’s Cloud business.  CFO Dipak Golechha was global divisional CFO/COO at P&G.


 
-  BoD: Only 2 internal directors, Arora (also Chairman of BoD) and founder Zuk.

 
  Operations (GAAP): Most recent quarter (3Q23, ended 4/30/23) and FY22 (Ended 7/31/22).
- FY22:
o Revenue: Generated revenue of 5.5B (+29.3% y/y) with $4.1B coming from Subscription & Support (S&S, 75.2% of revenue, +32% y/y) and the rest ($1.4B) from Product (24.8%, +22%).
o Margins: Margins grew versus 2021. 
o Income: Net loss of -$267M (+46.5% y/y).  This net loss was driven by considerable selling & marketing and R&D expenses which are expected for a value 3.0 company hoping to gain share in a growing TAM.  PANW became profitable in 4Q22 and has had 3 more profitable quarters since then. 
o FCF: Despite the net loss, generated FCF of $1.8B (+29.2%)
- 3Q23:
o Revenue: Generated revenue of $1.7B (+24.1 q/q) with $1.3B from S&S (77.4%, +2.3% q/q) and $388M from Product (22.6%, +10%). 
o Margins: Margins continued to widen q/q and growth in COGS slowed considerably (+15% Q1 to Q2, +7.8% Q2 to Q3). 
o Income: Net income was $107.8 (+28% q/q) and has grown each quarter since they first broke profitability in 4Q22.  Recent profitability can mostly be attributed to the declining COGS as SG&A spending has grown at a stable rate. 
o FCF: FCF was $400.9M in the quarter but declined from Q2 -38.9%.

#I. Company Thesis: Lithium-ion batteries have been used in portable electronics since the early-1990s.  In 2008, the launch of the lithium-ion powered Tesla Roadster illustrated how this technology could reduce emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.  These larger electric vehicle (“EV”) batteries require multitudes more lithium than prior battery cells and demand for the element skyrocketed.  Specialty chemicals producer Albemarle (“ALB”) stepped in to fill that void, and by acquiring rival Rockwood in 2015, became the largest lithium producer and processor in the US.  Incorporated in 1994 as a spin-off of Ethyl Corporation’s chemical business, ALB has decades of experience in extracting and processing lithium, bromine, and other specialty chemicals for commercial use.  With a mission to be “committed to building a more resilient world,” ALB has invested heavily in its lithium capabilities in the pursuit of “serving both people and the planet.”  Ever since automakers began developing EVs, lithium, and by extension ALB, has experienced a significant boom-and-bust cycle.  In these cycles, the price of lithium initially rallied by as much as 1300% (2020-2022) and then fell more than -80% (2023-2024) from its peak.  While many questions remain about the timeline of EV demand and lithium price trajectory, we believe that, in the long run, these key drivers of ALB’s growth will recover.  Given its US domicile, one of the leading positions in the market, and diverse, low-base extraction/processing portfolio in parts of the world with relatively stable geopolitical risk dynamics, we believe that investing in a leading Lithium miner such as ALB at historically low valuations is one of the optimal ways to participate in the EV sub-theme of our broader Renewables theme.

#II.Company Basics:

#a) CEO (Tenure) & Market Cap: J. Kent Masters Jr. (4 years); Market Cap: $ TBD Bn.
#b) Multiples (Current year): TBD x P/E, TBD x P/S, TBD x P/CF, TBD x EV/EBITDA, TBD % dividend yield.
#c) 1, 3, & 5-Year Return (Ann. Through 2/20/24): TBD %, TBD %, TBD %; TBD% from 52-week high and TBD % from ATH.
#d) Business Mix (% of sales): Energy Storage (TBD%; Lithium), Specialties (TBD%; Bromine), Catalysts (TBD%; Used in oil refining).

#III.Investment Highlights:

#a) EV Transition: Lithium is an essential component of EV batteries, a key driver of the energy transition; Although demand growth for EVs has fallen short of forecasts in 1Q24, 2024 is still expected to be another record EV sales year.  Although the timeline for mass adoption may have been pushed out, the long-term EV story remains strong as improved battery technology and regulatory support can continue to decrease price disadvantage and propel the industry forward.
#b) Lift from Solid State Batteries and Additional Use cases: Next step in EV battery technology provides roughly double the energy density, faster charging speed, and longer lifetime than the current iterations; Use much more lithium than the current batteries; Core long-term R&D focus for ALB; CTO Glen Merfield: “A fully solid-state battery is an ideal of where we want to go.” New ways to leverage lithium batteries in the grid or other forms of mobility would reduce ALB ‘s reliance on EV demand and expand its TAM.
#c) Onshoring: US was the largest global lithium producer in 1990s, but Australia, Chile, and China now dominate due to cost advantage; In an environment where we see the US working to onshore raw material production, ALB stands to benefit; EV credits from IRA require that critical battery materials, like lithium, are eventually sourced from the US or trading partners, further incentivizing ALB to expand domestic production ALB is increasingly investing domestically (Kings Mountain, NC in 2017, SC Mega-Flex facility in 2023) to reaccelerate US lithium production/processing.
#d) Supply Contraction: ALB management has said that at current prices, the global lithium supply would contract, helping the market become less oversupplied.  In 4Q24, ALB announced a $300M-$500M decrease in 2024 capex, placed an emphasis on projects significantly progressed or in startup stage, and a reduction in operating costs of $95M annually, largely in SG&A.
#e) Market Leadership: ALB competes closely with SQM for leadership of the lithium market in terms of production (SQM 20% share, ALB 16%) and market cap (SQM $12B, ALB $13.5B); Prominence and location in the US makes ALB the go-to provider for battery makers.
#f) Recycling Capability: ALB’s South Carolina facility opened in March 2023, its first that can process lithium from recycled batteries; Brings additional lithium into its ecosystem without the costly extraction process.
#g) Attractive Valuation: ALB is trading at historically low multiples (P/E is currently in the bottom quintile over the last 10 years) due to the severe price correction in lithium; From the November 2022 peak to 2/21/24, lithium is down -83% peak and ALB is down -63% to its 3-year low.





#IV. Investment Concerns:

#a) Lithium and other Commodity Prices: ALB’s profitability depends on the volatile lithium prices and its other commodity-based products; Lithium price volatility in recent cycles has been quite elevated especially considering the bumpy EV transition: First, between 2015-2018 lithium rallied 230% and then fell -50%. Then, from 2022-present lithium rallied 1300% and then fell -80%.  Industry consensus is that prices might be close to bottoming out but there is a fair bit of uncertainty regarding Lithium's future price trajectory.
#b) EV Demand: EV battery production is ALB’s most important growth driver but growth in demand for new EVs has been falling recently globally as well as in the US where the EV share of new car purchases has stabilized at around 9% and automakers have slowed production due to falling demand.  While EV penetration is expected to grow, the growth trajectory is a bit uncertain at this point of time.
#c)Lithium Oversupply: Increases in lithium production over the past couple years along with slowing demand have driven the price of lithium down.  While ALB and other producers are shuttering production and reducing capex, it might take some time for the oversupply to normalize.
#d)Stiff Competition: Significant, but not dominant, market share;; Face stiff competition from domestic producers in the largest lithium producing countries, Australia, Chile, and China; Automakers (Tesla, GM) and energy companies (Exxon) are also investing in lithium processing operations of their own.
#e Growing Leverage and Dwindling FCF: ALB hit a record low -824MM of FCF generation in 2023 and is expected to be in a negative FCF situation for the next three years despite their plans to reduce Capex and cut costs. Also, the significant drop in their market cap and EBITDA has resulted in an increase in their gearing ratio (Net Debt/EBITDA ~5.4x) and lower coverage ratio (EBIT /Interest coverage ~2.2x). While their debt maturity schedule looks manageable (~400MM maturity in 2025 and ~650MM in 2027), continued FCF and profitability headwinds from low Lithium prices can lead to increased funding liquidity pressure and even the risk of losing their BBB rating. 
#f) China Risk: China houses $819M (8% of total long-lived assets) of ALB’s PP&E/joint ventures and accounts for 30% of its revenue; China removed its tariffs on EV-related lithium products at the beginning of 2024; However, ff geopolitical tension increases, China may increase purchases from domestic producers/SQM (Chinese lithium producer Tianqi holds a ~23% stake) to the detriment of ALB or impose tariffs, which would materially impact ALB’s profits.
#g) Non-Lithium Technology: There are several potential energy storage solutions that leverage non-lithium substances like sodium or hydrogen which would pose a threat to demand for ALB’s products; Threat is uncertain as no alternative is currently able to compete with lithium.
#h) Environmental Regulation: Subject to strenuous regulation surrounding mining operations in the US.

II.  Macroeconomic Background:

A.  Health Care and the Economy:
The health care sector  has  a complicated and multifaceted  relationship  with the overall macroeconomic health  of  the  economy.    On  the  one  hand,  the  health  care  system  plays  an  important  role  in  overall population  health,  contributing  positively  to  standards  of  living  and  productivity.  From  this  lens, consumption of health care products and services is a positive contributor to overall GDP.  On the other hand, the recent history of health care in the U.S. has seen tremendous advances in medical technology, accompanied,  however,  by  alarming  increases  in  the  costs  of  care.    This  continued  trend  of  health  care inflation outpacing economic growth has led to concerns about health care spending by corporations and governments  crowding  out  many  other  critical  expenditures  (e.g.,  infrastructure,  R&D).    Importantly, health care spending is stable across bull and bear markets and certain HC subsectors may be marginally countercyclical.
stable across bull and bear markets and certain HC subsectors may be marginally countercyclical.  This increases the sector’s attractiveness for investment as it should act as performance and volatility mitigator when included as part of a multi-sector fund (Beta below 1.0).
Early 20th Century to Mid-20th Century (US)

Pre-1950s: US health care costs were relatively low as a percentage of GDP and stable.  Medical

technology  was  less  advanced,  and  most  people  paid  for  health  care  services  out-of-pocket.

President Truman becomes first leader to push for national health insurance.  Although Truman's

ambitious  plans  did  not  materialize  during  his  presidency,  his  efforts  laid  the  groundwork  for

future discussions and developments in healthcare policy. His advocacy highlighted the need for

expanded  healthcare  access  and  set  the  stage  for  later  reforms,  including  the  establishment  of

Medicare and Medicaid.

Post  World-War  II:  The  introduction  of  employer-sponsored  insurance  plans,  an  unplanned

outcome  of  the  GI  Act,  led  to  more  people  having  access  to  medical  services.    This  increased

demand, coupled with advances in medical technology, began to drive up health care costs.

Sector Analysis—Healthcare

1960s to 1980s





1960s: The establishment of Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. in 1965 provided critically needed health coverage to elderly and low-income Americans, respectively.  This greatly increased access to health care services and contributed to rising costs. 1970s-1980s: Health care costs continued to rise sharply due to inflation, increased utilization of medical services, and advancements in medical technology.  Economists began signaling a warning call about health care spending outpacing general economic growth.

Late 20th Century
Late 20th Century



1980s-1990s:  The drive to control costs led to the more wide-spread creation of health maintenance organizations  (HMOs)  and  managed  care  systems,  which  focused  on  preventive  care  and  cost- effective  treatment  options.    Providers  also  began  to  reorganize,  forming  larger  and  larger economic units such as Integrated Delivery Systems, in part as an attempt to improve the efficiency of health care delivery and also as a reaction to the market pressure exerted by the Payors/HMOs. Despite  these  efforts,  health  care  costs  continued  to  rise,  driven  by  factors  such  as  the  aging population and new expensive medical treatments.

21st Century to Present
21st Century to Present







2000s: Health care costs continued to increase,  usually  outpacing general inflation.   Key  drivers include  chronic  disease  prevalence,  obesity  rates,  administrative  costs,  and  technological advancements. 2010s: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was introduced in 2010, aiming to expand coverage, control costs, and improve the overall health care system.  While the ACA helped reduce the number of uninsured, it did not significantly bend the cost curve downward for health inflation. 2020s: The COVID-19 pandemic led to surges in spending on emergency responses, vaccination campaigns,  and  ongoing  treatment  for  those  infected.  Telehealth  expanded  rapidly  as  an alternative  to  in-person  visits.  Medtech/biotech  enters  into  a  “golden  age”  that  promises increasingly effective treatments, albeit at high price tags.  Health care spending as percentage of GDP and the federal budget reaches new highs.
Questionable Sustainability of Health Care Inflation After decades of high health care inflation, health care expenditures in the U.S. have reached 17.8% of GDP in 2023, roughly double the rate of other OECD countries.  The National Health, Education, and Welfare Administration (NHE) projects that the health spending share of GDP will increase to 19.6% in 2031, due to average health care inflation of 5.4% from 2022–2031 compared to the average GDP growth of 4.6%.  In other words, in just seven years, roughly $1 out of every $5 spent in the nation will go for health care.

Health care expenditures are also one of the largest drivers of the U.S. debt crisis.  In fiscal year 2023, the Kaiser  Family  Foundation reported  that  federal  spending  on  domestic  and  global  health  programs  and services made up 29% of net federal outlays, or $1.9 trillion out of $6.4 trillion. This includes:

Medicare: 13%

Medicaid and CHIP: 10%

Other domestic health spending: 4%
Medicare: 13%

Medicaid and CHIP: 10%

Other domestic health spending: 4%

Hospital and medical care for veterans: 2%

Global health: 0.1%

Sector Analysis—Healthcare

Consistent with the theme, “It’s all about entitlements, stupid,” roughly 80% of these expenditures are mandatory absent changes in the law.  Despite this, there is little to no political activity advocating for health care entitlement reform.  Regulators and lawmakers have instead focused on reducing costs by limiting the profits of Big Pharma and the largest payors (such as UNH), which while potentially offering short-term savings also risks destabilizing the sector.
Golden Age of Health Care Technology Breakthroughs in cell and gene therapies (including CRISPR); new technologies such as mRNA and GLP- 1; and the promise for AI to improve health care data analysis, diagnostics, and predictive analytics and speed up drug development are leading the way in what many believe will be a golden age for health care technology (biotech/medtech)1.

Cell and Gene Therapy Cell  and  gene  therapy  hold  transformative  promise  due  to  their  potential  to  treat  chronic  or  genetic conditions that were previously considered untreatable. Cell therapy involves introducing living cells into a patient to replace or repair damaged tissue, treat a disease, or boost the immune system.2 Gene therapy

1 Other promising technologies include:

Immuno-oncology Agents: These drugs help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. New types of immuno-

oncology treatments, such as bispecific antibodies and cancer vaccines, are under development.
oncology treatments, such as bispecific antibodies and cancer vaccines, are under development.

Targeted Protein Degradation: This category includes drugs designed to eliminate disease-causing proteins in the body. Protac

molecules (proteolysis targeting chimeras) are a prime example, which can target specific proteins for degradation by the cell's

natural waste disposal system.

Senolytics: These are drugs that selectively induce death of senescent cells—cells that have stopped dividing and contribute to

aging and age-related diseases. Senolytics have the potential to treat a variety of age-associated conditions.

Microbiome Modulators: These drugs aim to treat diseases by altering the composition of the microbiome. They may either

involve the use of living microorganisms (probiotics), non-viable microorganisms or their components (postbiotics), or substances

that selectively stimulate beneficial microbes (prebiotics).
that selectively stimulate beneficial microbes (prebiotics).

(RNAi Therapeutics: RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics involve silencing specific genes that are implicated in a disease. They

can prevent the production of harmful proteins before they are even made.

Antisense Oligonucleotides: Similar to RNAi, antisense drugs bind to mRNA and inhibit the production of disease-related

proteins by targeting their genetic blueprint.

BCMA-Targeted Therapies: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein that is expressed on the surface of plasma cells.

Targeting BCMA has shown promise in treating multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer of plasma cells.

2 Types of Cell Therapy

1.

Stem Cell Therapy:

Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs): Commonly used in bone marrow transplants to treat blood-related diseases like

leukemia and lymphoma.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs): Used for their ability to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and fat cells, making them
useful in regenerative medicine for conditions such as osteoarthritis and traumatic injuries.



Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs): These have the potential to become any cell type in the body, offering possibilities for treating a wide range of diseases.

2.

Immune Cell Therapy:

CAR-T Cell Therapy: T cells are genetically engineered to better recognize and attack cancer cells. This has shown

significant success in treating certain blood cancers.

Dendritic Cell Therapy: Dendritic cells are modified to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells or infectious

agents. 3.  Other Cell Types:

Chondrocytes: Used in the treatment of cartilage defects and injuries.

involves  modifying  or  replacing  defective  genes  within  a  patient’s  cells.    Cell  and  gene  therapy  hold significant promise in such areas as cancer treatment, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, and medicine. personalized
Messenger RNA Technology (mRNA) mRNA technology is a groundbreaking method for creating vaccines and therapeutics. It works by using synthetic mRNA, which is a molecule that tells cells how to make proteins.  The mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles to facilitate its entry into  human cells and these nanoparticles are what make up the vaccine or therapeutic agent. The biggest success to date for mRNA technology has been its use to develop the  COVID-19  vaccines  (both  Pfizer-BioNTech’s  and  Moderna’s).  Advantages  include  the  speed  of development, efficacy, the ability to quickly update vaccines in response to viral mutations, and safety (e.g., they  are  non-integrating,  meaning  they  don’t  enter  the  cell’s  DNA).    mRNA  technology  has  proven therapeutic  efficacy  in  such areas  as  infectious  disease,  immunotherapy,  genetic  disorders,  regenerative medicine, and cancer.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) Agonists GLP-1 Agonists are a class of type 2 diabetes drugs that not only improve blood sugar control but also lead to significant weight loss.3  Although weight loss can vary depending on which GLP-1 drug you use and your  dose,  all  GLP-1  drugs  can  lead  to  weight  loss  of  about  10.5-15.8  pounds  when  using  liraglutide (Source: Mayo).4  Patients using semaglutide and making lifestyle changes lost about 33.7 pounds.  These drugs mimic the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1.  When blood sugar leves start to rise after someone eats, these drugs stimulate the body to produce more insulin, helping to lower blood sugar levels.  GLP-1s also  help curb hunger  and slow  the  movement  of  food from the stomach into  the small intesting.  In part due to the weight loss, these drugs also have been found to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke,  and  kidney  disease  and  improve  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol  levels.
disease, stroke,  and  kidney  disease  and  improve  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol  levels.    GLP-1s  are  already blockbuster drugs and have been to reach sales of $100 billion by 2030 (JP Morgan Research).
Artificial Intelligence Applications AI already has a significant history of being applied to health care, beginning with the field of diagnostics. The success there, even with rudimentary AI systems, suggests that AI will have numerous applications to health care moving forward. An incomplete list follows:



Improved  Diagnostics:  AI  algorithms  can  assist  in  diagnosing  diseases  by  interpreting  medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy.  This can lead to earlier detection of medical conditions.



Pancreatic Islet Cells: Used in diabetes treatment to restore normal insulin production. 3 A second class of drugs with similar promise is the sodium glucose contransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. 4 Diabetes drugs in the GLP-1 agonists class are generally taken by a shot (injection) given daily or weekly and include:

Exenatide extended release (Bydureon bcise) (weekly)

Exenatide (Byetta) (twice daily)

Dulaglutide (Trulicity) (weekly)

Personalized Medicine: AI can analyze a patient’s genetic information, lifestyle and environment

to tailor treatment plans specific to the individual.

Predictive Analytics: By analyzing the vast amount of data stored in electronic health records and

other  sources,  AI  can  identify  trends  and  predict  outbreaks,  patient  outcomes,  and  disease

progression, allowing for earlier and more precise interventions.

Drug Discovery and Development: AI can accelerate the process of drug discovery by predicting

how  different  drugs  will  interact  with  target  populations,  assisting  with  the  identification  of
promising drug candidates, and analyzing vast amounts of clinical data more rapidly than could

be done before.

Surgical Assistance: AI tools can provide surgeons with real-time insights, superior monitoring,

and enhanced visualizations, potentially reducing human error.

Virtual Health Assistants: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide patients with

medical information, remind them to take medications, or monitor chronic conditions.

Wearable Technology: In health care’s version of moving to the edge, wearable devices such as

smart watches, fitness trackers, and health patches enable continuous monitoring, real-time data

analysis, and proactive health management.  This has applications such as remote monitoring of

chronic conditions and real-time alerts such as when a patient suffers a stroke.

Telehealth and Remote Monitoring: AI can enhance telehealth services by providing diagnostic
Telehealth and Remote Monitoring: AI can enhance telehealth services by providing diagnostic

support  during  virtual  consultations  and  continuously  monitoring  patient’s  health  remotely,

offering timely interventions.

Operational  Efficiency:  AI  can streamline  administrative  tasks  such  as  scheduling,  billing,  and

patient flow management.
To the extent that these new technologies offer the hope for long-term cures, they clearly will be the focus of  significant  investment.    Whether  their  success  will  increase  or  decrease  health  care  costs  as  a  whole, however, is debatable.  As discussed in a recent Time Magazine article, “As exciting as the possible new medications are, they also raise questions about affordability and accessibility. Innovative drug treatments involving gene therapy and CRISPR, for example, are designed to be one-time treatments that can mitigate the need for repeated and often lifelong medical care. But that means higher upfront costs, and it’s not clear whether insurers will cover such hefty price tags. As more therapies reach the market, however, they could change the reimbursement structure as insurers will likely feel increasing pressure to cover treatments that could be not just life-changing but also potentially curative—and save millions in long-term  health care costs.”
As in our Technology sector analysis, we believe that the rate of adoption for new healthcare technologies will follow the “S Curve”, also known as the diffusions of innovations theory.  The curve is typically shaped like  an  “S,”  with  slow  initial  growth  as  innovators  and  early  adopters  begin  to  experiment  with  the technology.  This is followed by a rapid acceleration as the technology gains momentum and is adopted by the  early  majority  and  eventually  late  majority.    Finally,  the  curve  tapers  off  as  the  technology  reaches saturation among the laggards.  Initially, the costs for these new treatments will be quite expensive, likely contributing  to  healthcare  inflation.    Over  the  long-term,  one  would  hope  that  new  treatments  would reduce overall costs by preventing any number of costly chronic conditions (e.g., healthy people need fewer health care services).  We can see this playing out, for example, with the recent class of weight loss
care services).  We can see this playing out, for example, with the recent class of weight loss drugs. Short-term costs are high and system savings will take years to play out.  Ultimately, bending the health care  curve  will  likely  require  significant  new  therapeutic  and  curative  treatments  across  the  “Big  4”: cardiovascular  disease,  insulin  resistance  (diabetes),  caner,  and  neurodegenerative  disease  (Alzheimers, Parkinsons).

III.  Subsector Investment Thesis:

SCP has extensive experience with the health care sector.  Consistent with the macroeconomic view above, SCP is focusing its investments in (1) companies which can commercialize promising new technologies (i.e., take advantage of the Golden Age for medtech/biotech), and (2) companies that can work in partnership with the federal government to finally bend the curve downward on health care inflation and bring health care costs onto a more sustainable path.  Consequently, SCP has focused its investments in three critical subsectors: Big Pharma, Payors and Providers, and Medtech/Biotech.

A.  Big Pharma:

"Big Pharma" refers to the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, which play a significant role in the

healthcare industry by conducting critical research and development (typically  up to 15% of revenues),
developing  new  drugs  that  demonstrate  clinical  efficacy,  and  then  bringing  these  drugs  to  market,

including navigating through the labyrinth of clinical trials.  Apart from developing their drugs pipeline

via internal R&D, these companies also frequently acquire biotech companies to bolster and complement

their product portfolio. Big Pharma’s product portfolios include a wide range of medicines, vaccines, and

biotechnology  products  that  cater  to  therapeutic  areas  including  oncology,  cardiology,  neurology,

immunology,  and  infectious  diseases.  They  also  operate  on  a  global  scale,  with  sales  and  operations

spanning numerous continents.

The pharmaceutical sector has continued to grow rapidly over the last two decades, with global revenues

reaching $1.48 trillion in 2022 (source Statista).  Big Pharma comprises a large portion of the sector, with
sales  in  2022  of  $949  billion  (approximately  65%  market  share).    In  that  same  year,  these  large

6

Stamos Capital Partners, L.P.

Sector Analysis—Healthcare

pharmaceutical companies made an impressive $112 billion in profits.  Given their considerable cash flow

and solid balance sheets, Big Pharma also play a critical role in the innovation ecosphere.  First, they invest heavily into their own R&D on emerging technologies.  Second, by acquiring smaller, often venture-backed

innovators, they provide an exit option for early investors while refreshing their product pipelines.  Finally,

they  enter  into  strategic  alliances  with  innovators,  including  venture-backed  firms,  large  technology

companies such as Google and Microsoft, and universities, leveraging the sales and distribution reach of

Big Pharma and providing a path to commercialization for promising technologies.5

Public and policymaker perception of Big Pharma is decidedly mixed.  On the one hand, they are rightfully

credited  with  bringing  to  market  cost-  and  life-saving  treatments.  On  the  other  hand,  their  success  in

generating large profit margins leads to accusations of inequitable pricing and sales practices, putting them

in the sights of regulators worldwide.  Similar to SCP’s thesis on the large oil majors and their critical role

in  energy  transformation,  however,  we  believe  that  Big  Pharma  is  a  vital  and  necessary  piece  of  the

equation for leveraging the promise of AI and gene and cell therapy. They have the resources to make such

innovations possible and the product management and marketing skills and the distribution network to

commercialize  these  innovations.

Our  investment  thesis,  therefore,  is  to  identify  the  leading
Our  investment  thesis,  therefore,  is  to  identify  the  leading

pharmaceutical  companies  worldwide  who  are  poised  to  and  have  the  wherewithal  to  make  such

investments, both through their own R&D as well as through acquisitions and alliances, and also effectively

monetize them through their marketing efforts and distribution network.  Given the increasingly high costs

of prescription medicine and the high price tags for new cell and gene therapies, SCP also believes that Big

Pharma must work closely with governments around the world to ensure affordable access to their life

saving products and help to bend the curve  on  health  care inflation.  Companies that can balance  such

public/private partnerships (e.g., demonstrate regulatory expertise and finesse) while still maintaining top- tier performance will command a premium in the capital markets.

1.  Possible Subsector Tailwinds:

a.  Increasing Demand Due to Favorable Demographics: As the global population continues to grow and age, there will be increasing demand for healthcare services, including pharmaceuticals.  Such increasing demand should translate into revenue growth.

b.  Technological  Advancements/Strong  Pipeline:  As  discussed,  advancements  such  as  AI  and genomics  are  driving  considerable  innovation  in  the  sector.    Companies  that  succeed  in commercializing  such  technologies  will  have  strong  pipelines  of  new  products,  operate  more efficiently, and earn market premiums.
c.  GLP-1 Blockbusters: As noted, there is an impressive demand for these new anti-obesity/type 2 diabetes drugs and to date they have been able to attract premium pricing.  Companies with strong GLP-1 product pipelines will clearly be among the winners in the next few years.  The impact of these drugs is so broad that they have implications downstream for payors who must struggle with the additional short-term costs of these drugs, for medtech companies who will sell fewer weight- related devices (e.g., CPAP, insulin monitors), and even for food companies who will need to retool their offerings for a healthier customer base.

d.  Emerging Market Demand: To the extent that emerging markets are successful in growing their middle  classes  and  improving  access  to  healthcare  services  population-wide,  pharmaceutical companies will have new growth opportunities and the ability to diversify their revenue streams.
e.  M&A/Collaboration Opportunities: Big Pharma in general has strong balance sheets and

sufficient dry powder that can be utilized to buy out promising but smaller and unprofitable biotech companies at discounted prices as the latter are struggling due to higher for longer rate environment and a tough funding environment.

f.  Specialty  Drugs:  A  number  of  large  pharmaceutical  companies  are  increasingly  focusing  on specialty  drugs—high-cost  medications  used  to  treat  complex  and  rare  diseases.  Such  drugs typically have higher pricing potential and profitability.
g.  Attractive Investment Characteristics:   Big  Pharma  companies  typically  enjoy  strong  balance sheets,  stable  cash  flows/earnings,  low  cyclicality,  strong  dividends  (level  and  growth),  and attractive valuations (due in part to election-related risks and patent cliffs).  Consequently, these companies  are  attractive  investments  and  provide  ballast  in  client  portfolios,  especially  given today’s  inflated  valuations,  higher-for-longer  rate  environment,  and  elevated  geopolitical  risk regime.

2.  Sector Headwinds
2.  Sector Headwinds

a.  Potential Regulation and Legislation:  Governments across the globe are focused on controlling the cost of prescription medicine and are highly likely to implement new regulations and health care  reforms  that  limit  the  pricing  flexibility  of  the  sector.    The  most  recent  U.S.  example  is  the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which for the first time empowers Medicare to negotiate prices for certain  high-cost  prescription  drugs  directly  with  pharmaceutical  companies.  This  negotiation process will begin with a selected list of drugs, expanding over time to include more medications. Drug manufacturers are also required to pay rebates to Medicare if they increase the prices of their medications faster than the rate of inflation. Finally, the act includes a specific provision to cap the monthly cost of insulin at $35 for Medicare beneficiaries. Note that implementation of the IRA has

been delayed due to the complexity of price negotiations and the need to build need administrative systems.

b.  Impending Patent Cliff: All drug companies bear the risk of losing patent protection (20 years) or losing  exclusivity  (usually  5  years)  for  their  products  which  allows  competition  from  generic alternatives  and  reduces  profitability.  Patent  expirations  over  2023-2030  could  leave  more  than $350bn of large-pharma annual sales exposed to generics, with US drugmakers more at risk than their EU counterparts.  Consensus analysis sees ~$140bn in potential sales erosion over this period for the peer group.
c.  Drug  Development  Costs:  The  costs  of  bringing  new  drugs  to  market  are  increasing  due  to increasingly stringent regulations, the requirement for larger and more complex clinical trials, and increasingly high R&D costs as companies pursue new technologies.  Median cost of launching a new  drug  is  approximately  $1bn,  with  no  guarantees  that  initial  sunk  costs  will  be  recovered should the product fail during approval process.

d.  Intense Competition: Big Pharma faces competitive pressure from both their peers as well as new entrants,  including  venture-backed  biotech  companies  and  startups.    This  creates  the  need  to constantly innovate and differentiate their products.
e.  Poor Public Perception:  The pharmaceutical company has been intensively scrutinized for their pricing  methodologies,  their  marketing  practices,  excessive  profit  taking,  and  the  opioid  crisis. Such coverage has led to a decline in public trust which can impact the industry’s ability to attract capital, partners, and customers.

B.  Payors and Providers: Although  payors  and  providers  typically  sit  across  from  each  other  at  the  negotiating  table6,  they  both  are essential stakeholders in the drive for cost containment and quality improvement.  Both sides will play a critical

Health insurance companies: Commercial insurance providers that offer health coverage to individuals, families, and employers. Employer-sponsored health plans: Health insurance plans provided by employers to their employees. Managed care organizations (MCOs): Organizations that manage and coordinate healthcare services for their members in exchange for fixed premiums (e.g., health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations). Health savings accounts (HSAs) and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs): Tax-advantaged accounts used to pay for qualified medical expenses.

Providers:

a. Hospitals:

Acute care hospitals: Provide short-term medical treatment for a severe injury or episode of illness.

role moving forward and increasingly collaboration between the two subsectors will be required to move the needle on bending the health care inflation curve.  Successful payors and providers will need to manage the convergence  of  new  technology,  regulatory  changes,  and  cost  containment  demands.    Interestingly,  many leading payors have started vertically integrating with providers to better control cost ratios (e.g., primary care clinics, telemedicine, urgent care, etc.) Our investment thesis, therefore, is to identify the leading payors and

providers that can strategically manage this convergence.
More specifically, SCP is seeking to invest in companies that can successfully manage the application of the new treatment technologies (e.g., gene and cell therapy, mRNA, etc.) as well as leverage AI, including enhanced data analytics, data driven decision making, telehealth and remote monitoring/wearables, automated claims adjustment, robotic automated tasks, etc.  Companies that can leverage blockchain technology to create secure and seamless data transfer of confidential records will also have an edge up. As with Big Pharma, large payors 7 and  providers  will  also  need  to  demonstrate  considerable  regulatory  agility  as  the  state  and  federal governments pursue health care reform. Finally, players who are able to lead efforts at cost containment will receive  market  premiums,  including  such  capitalizing  on  recent  trends  such  as  personalized  medicine,  the application of behavioral economics to consumer behavior, increased emphasis on preventive and holistic
of behavioral economics to consumer behavior, increased emphasis on preventive and holistic care, increased focus on health equity and social determinants, and new payment models (e.g., value-based care, bundled payments or accountable care organizations).
1.  Possible Subsector Tailwinds:

a.  Technological Advancements: innovations in healthcare technologies, such as the application of AI, cell and gene therapies, remote monitoring and telemedicine, and blockchain-driven electronic health records can improve efficiency, patient experience and health outcomes.

b.  New Payment Modalities: The shift from  traditional  fee-for-service to value-based  care models will reward providers for the quality of care they provide, not the quantity.  This should reduce unnecessary costs and incentivize preventive care.

c.  Aging Demographics: As the populations of the world’s most developed economies age, this will create increased demand for payors and providers.  A cautionary note, however, is that this trend may also increase costs as older individuals consume more healthcare services than younger ones, on average.

d.  Policy Support: The flipside of  costly regulation and  bureaucracy  are innovative public-private
partnerships that expand coverage, control costs, and improve outcomes.

e.  Subsector Consolidation/Vertical  Integration: The  ongoing consolidation  occurring  in both the payor  and  provider  subsectors  should  create  opportunities  for  economies  of  scale,  improved negotiating power, and sufficient scale to make the infrastructure investments required to achieve the  promise  of  new  technologies.    We  are  also  observing  increasing  vertical  integration  among

Nursing homes: Facilities that provide long-term care for elderly or disabled individuals who require assistance with daily activities. Home health agencies: Provide medical and non-medical services to patients in their homes. Pharmacies: Dispense prescription medications to patients and provide counseling on their use.

2.  Possible Subsector Headwinds:
2.  Possible Subsector Headwinds:

a.  Political/Headline Risk: Particularly in this election year, large payors and providers are targets for policy makers seeking to find cost savings in the healthcare system.  At the minimum, this will create  short-term  volatility  as  the  market  responds  to  the  negative  press.    It  might  also  be  a precursor to regulation or legislation aimed at curbing the pricing power of the sector (e.g., witness pharmaceutical provisions in Inflation Reduction Act).

b.  Regulatory Challenges:  Frequent changes in healthcare laws, regulations, and policies can pose compliance  challenges  and  create  uncertainty.    This  can  increase  costs  and  require  constant adaptation.

c.  Cybersecurity Threats:  The flipside of the promise of AI in healthcare, as healthcare payors and providers move toward the increasing digitization of services, the opportunity for cybersecurity attacks increase as well.
d.  Aging Demographics: As mentioned above, while the aging of the consumer population creates increased healthcare demand, it also significantly increases patient acuity (severity of illness) and the prevalence of chronic diseases.  This drives the need for more costly and complex care. e.  Cap-Ex Requirements:   Building, maintaining and upgrading infrastructure to pursue such trends

as AI and cell and gene therapies will require significant capital investment.

f.  Workforce Shortages: The healthcare industry faces shortages of skilled professionals, including

doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, limiting the efficiency of care delivery.

C.  Biotechnology and Medtech

Higher for Longer Exposure:  Many biotech companies have relatively weak balance sheets and negative free cash flow, which exposes them to considerable risk in the current higher for longer rate environment.  Such companies are constantly turning to public or private markets to obtain the capital they require to survive the lengthy process to bring new solutions to market.

b.  Regulatory Challenges: Ongoing changes in regulatory requirements add cost and uncertainty to

the process, which has historically been time-consuming, complex, and expensive.

c.  GLP-1  Blockbusters:  The  success  of  these  drugs  in  reducing  obesity  is  so  broad  that  they  have implications  downstream  for  payors  who  must  struggle  with  the  additional  short-term  costs  of

these drugs, for medtech companies who will sell fewer weight-related devices (e.g., CPAP, insulin monitors),  and  even  for  food  companies  who  will  need  to  retool  their  offerings  for  a  healthier customer base.

d.  Supply  Chain  Disruptions:  The  biotech  industry  relies  on  a  complex  global  supply  chain  for research materials, reagents, and manufacturing components.  Disruptions can delay development and distribution.

e.  Data Privacy and Cybersecurity: The flipside of the digitization of health care is greater exposure to  cybersecurity  attacks,  including  many  sponsored  by  government  actors.  Data  and  privacy breaches can be enormously expensive and result in a considerable erosion in customer goodwill. Intellectual Property Concerns: Protecting IP is critical in biotech and medtech.  Patent litigation and patent expirations can erode competitive advantages.

g.  Clinical Trial Risks: Clinical trials are necessary but failure to demonstrate efficacy or safety can

halt progress and lead to significant financial losses.

h.  Talent Shortage: The increasingly specialized nature  of  biotech/medtech  requires highly skilled

professionals and talent shortages are common.

I.	Company Thesis:  Barclays plc (“BCS”) traces its origins back to John Freame, who, in 1690, founded a goldsmith banking business in London. Eventually taking on the name Barclays after Freame’s son-in-law, James, the bank first reached prominence in 1896 when 12 London and provincial banking houses combined with BCS, to make up 25% of English deposits.  The business grew significantly during the 20th century, both in the UK and abroad in Europe, Britain’s colonies, and the US, turning BCS from the preeminent British financial institution into one of the world’s most respected money center banks.  BCS was a constructive presence in the US during the GFC where it led the acquisition of Lehman Brothers and cemented itself a place on Wall Street.  During the GFC, BCS was forced to raise $12B to stay out of UK regulators’ hands and raised money primarily from the Middle East (QIA), cut its dividend, and sold its lucrative BGI business (iShares) to BlackRock.  The GFC, e desperate cash raise efforts and concomitant dilution, the sale of billions of shares in 2009 by the Qataris, subsequent scandals (esp. LIBOR rigging), Brexit, execution missteps, and the overall industry headwinds have plunged BCS’ share price into a hole from which it has never fully emerged (-82% from ATH).  BCS has treaded water since the end of GFC. While initially we had invested at depressed valuations with conviction in a turnaround, the new CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan and his methodical, simple approach have given us increased faith in a solid, tangible catalyst for this turnaround.  Initial market response to this refreshed strategy revealed in 1Q24 has been positive and we have renewed confidence that the bank can reach the stated targets and re-rate as it starts hitting some of the carefully laid-out milestones.  With a pathway for more focused growth on the back of renewed clarity on its strategic direction, attractive shareholder yield, adequate buffer for execution mistakes given its cheap Price to book multiple, and a strong potential for further re-rating, BCS is an attractive investment.

II.	Company Basics:

a)	CEO (Tenure) & Market Cap: C.S. Venkatakrishnan (2.5 years); Market Cap: $TBD Bn
b)	Multiples (Current year): TBDx P/E (TBD x 1-yr. fwd.), TBD x P/B, TBD x P/TB, TBD x P/S, TBD % 12-mo. dividend yield
c)	1, 3-Year, & 5-Year Return (Ann. Through 4/26/24): TBD %, TBD %, TBD%; TBD % from 52-week high and TBD% from ATH.
d)	Business Mix (% of 2023 Sales): Barclays Investment Bank (TBD%; Includes Global Markets (TBD%), Investment Banking (TBD%), and Transaction Banking/Corp. Lending (TBD%) divisions), Barclays UK (TBD%, personal banking, Barclaycard UK, Business banking), Barclays US Consumer Bank (TBD%), Barclays UK Corporate Bank (TBD%), PWM (TBD%).  Recent restructuring puts Barclays UK as its own segment (“ring-fenced bank”) with the other 4 divisions being grouped together separately as “Barclays International”.  The split between Barclays International and Barclays UK is 69/31.
e)	Geographic Mix (% of Sales): UK (TBD%), Americas (TBD%, almost all US), Europe (TBD%), Asia (TBD%).

III.	Investment Highlights: 

a)	Valuation: Since the GFC, BCS has struggled to find footing with investors due to management turnover, scandals, execution missteps, Brexit, and a myriad of smaller macro and idiosyncratic factors.  As a result, BCS is the cheapest of all the banks SCP owns in terms of its P/B, P/TB, and P/E.  When companies that have the DNA and prominence of BCS fall to this level of relative cheapness, SCP sees an opportunity.  Our conviction in the UK economy and signs of progress from BCS on strategic initiatives make us comfortable investing at these prices given the strong dividend yield (4% 12 mo., 5.2% indicated), projected shareholder yield in double digits and potential for multiple expansion.
b)	Leadership: After nearly a decade of lackluster management, current CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan seems like the right man for the job.  Where the previous CEOs had focused on bold overhauls and sweeping proclamations, Venkatakrishnan, who comes from a risk management background (BCS CRO from 2016-2020), has moved more gradually, using the mantra “Simpler, Better, More Balanced” to guide the restructuring and turnaround of the bank.  SCP is much more confident that this more moderate, “cutting wheat in the field,” strategy can lead to an effective turnaround.
c)	Restructuring: In 1Q24, Venkatakrishnan announced his new vision for BCS as a “Simpler, Better, More Balanced,” bank.  BCS is getting 1) “Simpler” by reorganizing into 2 key segments: Barclays UK and Barclays International (Investment Bank, US Consumer Bank, UK Corporate Bank, PWM) which aligns private banking and wealth management and simplifies operations.  BCS is getting 2) “Better” in terms of its profitability and shareholder returns (targeting >12% Group RoTE through 2026 and $10B in payout through 2026), , quality of the income stream (target 70% of income to come from the more stable financing, retail, and corporate divisions by 2026), customer experience, and outcomes (Expand PWM, tailored service model, AI/online banking).  BCS is getting 3) “More Balanced” in its allocation of RWAs across business segments (reduce IB from 63% to 50% by 2026, focus on higher RoTE divisions) and geographically by refocusing on its UK home market and continuing to take Asian market share from US competitors.  The plan was well received by the market and BCS rose 8% the next day and is up 14% through 4/26.  If BCS can execute this plan for the rest of the year, SCP may consider re-classifying the company as a Value 2.0 name.
d)	Prominent Money Center Bank: BCS is the world’s 18th largest bank by total assets, has a leading global investment bank, is the top credit card issuer in the UK and has a prominent brand.  It also has a strong Tier I Common Equity/Capital (13.5%, 18% ratio). Also, given the breadth of its businesses, there are ample opportunities for cross-selling (corporate bank, IB, PWM). SCP believes that money center banks need to provide liquidity in the economy to reduce our reliance on monetary policy. Given its size, status, and location, BCS is naturally suited to benefit from this underappreciated macro tailwinds.  
e)	UK Recovery: Once the commercial hub of Europe, the UK has fallen out of favor amongst investors in the wake of Brexit and a political fiasco (3 PMs in as many years) with longer-term concerns around inflation, growth, and underinvestment looming.  SCP is confident in the UK economy’s long-term resilience given its 5+ decades of collective experience working in the UK and directly with BCS through Rhodes (macro-economic indicators since 3Q23 seem to agree).  After a brutal 2022, the UK moved sideways during 2023 (+0.5% GDP) and many of the challenges (inflation/gas costs, stagnating wages, rate hikes) have since alleviated.  These indicators and friendly comps give the UK, and BCS’ UK divisions, a chance to exceed expectations in 2024 (already did so for 1Q24).  The UK is a G7 economy with entrenched rule of law, stable governance, and developed financial markets making it an attractive country to invest in over the long-term.
f)	Interest Rates: In the higher-for-longer interest rate environment that we foresee, banks can potentially increase their NII and outperform other sectors. This is truer for UK and European focused banks compared to the US banks given their lower deposit beta and higher % of floating rate assets. However, please note that Barclays has a sophisticated treasury that is an active user of interest rate derivatives (more so than other European banks) to structurally hedge interest rate risk and dampen the impact of interest rates on its NII. 
 
IV.	Investment Concerns:

a)	Competition: BCS, along with HSBC, Lloyds, and NatWest make up the “Big Four” in British banking.  Lloyds and NatWest are more consumer/local banking-oriented and have more deposits while HSBC and BCS are both global, diversified money center banks.  HSBC is a much larger bank and leads BCS in deposits and assets.  BCS is reversing its strategy of investing in its investment banking division which faces stiff competition for staff and clients from other money center and investment banks, especially in the US.  Its UK and US consumer, corporate and PWM divisions are all subject to competition from a wide number of money center and regional banks and asset managers in the UK and global markets.  
b)	UK Underperformance: The short- and long-term issues with the UK economy discussed earlier in “Investment Highlights” are legitimate concerns and the economy may not have bottomed out and might have deeper structural issues that can lead to higher provisioning (risk magnified for BCS given its higher exposure to unsecured lending) and lower growth in its core market for BCS.  UK markets (FTSE 100 has underperformed US markets since the turn of the century and over most trailing medium-term and long-term lookback periods.  
c)	Turnaround: Until 1Q24, the market seemed unconvinced by Venkatakrishnan’s initiatives and, even with the positive response to their most recent report, BCS is still very much a “prove it” story and faces significant execution risks to achieving some of its ambitious targets.  
d)	Prior Governance: Since 2015 when the BoD promised to double BCS’ stock price in 3-4 years, the shares have lost ~40% of their value, former CEO Jes Staley was found to have closer ties to Jeffrey Epstein than disclosed, and in 2018 BCS paid $360M to settle a paperwork error (other settlements include LIBOR fixing, subprime mortgages etc.). Although we are confident in current CEO Venkatakrishnan, these recent slip-ups point to consistent poor governance that, if not fully rooted out, can derail the bank’s progress and result in costly settlements/litigation expenses.
e)	Balance Sheet: The bank still has some balance sheet concerns that may weigh it down with a high Texas ratio (13x) and amount of non-performing loans ($9.2B).
f)	Banking Regulation: BCS and other banks are subject to complex regulations pertaining to their business and capital base and these have continued to be tightened over time resulting in structural headwinds to growth and RoTE.

Title: A Consideration of Roku's Prospects Amid Challenges and Market Shifts


Introduction

In the dynamic and competitive landscape of streaming and digital advertising, Roku stands as a continuing example of strategic resilience and innovative growth. Despite Roku's stock being down 85% from its 2021 high, the company boasts a 40% share of the Connected TV Streaming market. With over 80 million active accounts, Roku is not just surviving the streaming wars; it is strategically positioned for the next phase of the shift from linear to streaming TV. This post examines Roku's journey, marked by financial fluctuations, strategic partnerships, competitive challenges, and the evolution of advertising and content distribution.

Streaming Evolution: Market Adaptation and User Engagement

Roku has demonstrated remarkable adaptability and strategic foresight, with its user base and streaming hours per user consistently growing. The company’s business, if not its stock price, has managed to hold up impressively through the streaming wars, reflecting its deep understanding of market dynamics and consumer preferences. Its leadership in the smart TV platform domain in the U.S., with a market share of about 40 to 45 percent of streaming hours, surpasses tech giants like Samsung, Google, and Amazon, showcasing its dominance in content consumption.

A testament to Roku's increasing significance in the digital era is the surge in streaming activity on its devices. The q4 2023 earnings call indicated that users streamed 26.7 billion hours in the quarter, marking a 22% increase from the previous year, which is particularly striking when compared to the traditional pay TV industry that saw a 15% decline in viewing hours over the same period. Moreover, the average streaming hours per active account per day rose to 3.9, a 5% increase year-over-year. Given that the average hours of TV watched in the US is 7.5 hours per day, this suggests there's still considerable room to grow in hours per day streamed on Roku, indicating a substantial opportunity for further engagement and market penetration.

Strategic Partnerships, Disputes, and Financial Signals

Roku's financial health and strategic partnerships underscore its savvy in navigating the complex digital media ecosystem. The potential acquisition of Vizio by Walmart introduces new competitive challenges, yet Roku's strategic moves, such as innovative partnerships and a strong focus on advertising, position it well in the market. The company's multifaceted business model, emphasizing hardware sales, subscriptions, and particularly advertising—with advertising being the largest and fastest-growing segment—highlights its strategic direction and adaptability. It is notable that The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green has recently repeatedly stated that Connected TV (CTV) is the most promising area for advertising going forward.

Advertising Innovations and Monetization Challenges

Roku's innovations in advertising, including the pioneering partnership with Shopify and the introduction of shoppable ads, reflect its commitment to enhancing monetization strategies. These initiatives demonstrate Roku's ability to leverage its platform for growth, offering novel experiences for viewers and opening new avenues for advertisers. However, the decline in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by 4% year over year to $39.92 on a trailing 12-month basis, primarily due to the expansion into international markets, presents monetization challenges that Roku aims to address through its diversified advertising strategies and continued focus on user engagement.

Facing Competitive Threats and Navigating Market Dynamics

Roku's strategic resilience is tested by competitive threats and market dynamics, including changes in privacy regulations and the evolving landscape of targeted advertising. The company's emphasis on maintaining a first-party relationship with customers and its adaptability in content strategy—transitioning from licensing to creating content—underscores its proactive approach to sustaining relevance and growth. Roku's streaming device market share, roughly equal with Amazon Fire at about 40%, and its dominance in the smart TV sector, highlight its strategic positioning amidst technological and regulatory shifts.

Financial Outlook and Strategic Resilience

Despite facing the largest-ever net loss, Roku's management exhibits strategic optimism, anchored in the belief that all television, including advertisements, will transition to streaming. This vision aligns with Roku's historical resilience, evidenced by its ongoing innovation and operational efficiencies. With over 400 FAST linear channels on The Roku Channel and the launch of high-profile channels like MrBeast, Roku continues to expand its content offerings, engaging users more deeply and enhancing its monetization capabilities.

Conclusion: Roku’s Stock Should Recover

Roku's journey through digital transformation illustrates a company at the intersection of technological innovation, strategic vision, and financial performance. Navigating challenges in ARPU performance, competitive threats, and content distribution, Roku demonstrates a strategic agility essential for success in the streaming and digital advertising sectors. The company's focus on diversifying revenue streams, deepening user engagement, and responding agilely to market dynamics positions it as a significant player in the evolving digital landscape. With a cautiously optimistic outlook, Roku's journey offers valuable insights into the complexities and opportunities of the streaming revolution.

Roku’s stock should fill much of the gap between today’s price and it’s historic highs, possibly even as an acquisition target.  It’s TV Operating System might make a nice add in for a company with Smart VR/AR glasses looking to compete with the Apple Vision Pro. Calling Mr. Zuckerberg?

ORIGINAL TEXT SUMMARY:
Welcome to the Meb Faber show, discussing ways to grow and preserve wealth. Meb Faber, co-founder and chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management, contributes to this podcast, but due to regulations, does not cover Cambria's funds. Today's guest is Paul Kim, co-founder and CEO of Simplify Asset Management, an ETF provider that assists advisors in building superior portfolios. Simplify focuses on long volatility ETFs that aim to generate income or hedge downside risk. The firm leverages options within an ETF structure, incorporating ideas from Kim's previous tenure at PIMCO. The conversation covers strategies for hedging bonds and stocks, as well as Simplify's thematic healthcare ETF, which donates all proceeds to charity. This episode was sponsored by WhiteCharts, a platform offering customizable reporting and proposal tools to enhance communication with clients, complete with fundamental charts, stock and fund screeners, and more.

Established last September, Simplify has launched 22 ETFs, managing around $1.2 billion in assets. Their investment focus primarily lies in long options, long convexity, and long asymmetric risk to maximize returns or income and primarily hedge downside risk. Investors can now access a blend of benefits with options put inside an ETF, and this grows more advantageous with expanding tax efficiency. The motto is to disintegrate and re-aggregate the value within an ETF. Innovative ideas are also available to democratize hedge fund type exposures and tail risk strategy, and these can be neatly packaged within an ETF without massive charges. This holds great promise to bring interesting exposures and portfolio protection to investors. However, launching an ETF company is a challenging venture, especially when up against established asset management giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard.

Innovative ideas are also available to democratize hedge fund type exposures and tail risk strategy and these can be neatly packaged within an ETF without massive charges. This holds great promise to bring interesting exposures and portfolio protection to investors. Yet launching an ETF company is a challenging venture, especially when up against established asset management giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard. In this context, some personal insights come from an individual who started at Pimco and built a robust active ETF fixed income business over six years. Post-2015, this experience was leveraged at Principal to launch another fresh ETF platform, thus gaining exposure on both sides of the ledger–equity and fixed income– and multi-asset experience. Active ETF business insights based on fixed income knowledge proved valuable in gaining more insights about the index side of ETFs. Further, the derivatives rule signaled a change in the regulatory framework, allowing more use of derivatives and leverage inside of a 40 Act, a move considered a game-changer for the industry. However, when discussed internally at Principal, it met with a stalemate. Subsequently, Simplify was initiated to leverage this opportunity amidst the pandemic in March 2020. Though fraught with risk, this entrepreneurial venture demanded a high degree of optimism to move forward. At Pimco, launching the big bond active ETF had its initial struggles due to an odd symbol, TRXT, which failed to attract assets. However, the subsequent switch to 'bond' led to a swift surge in assets. TRXT was originally the ticker for an ETF managed by PIMCO, a decision made out of limited options. However, the lead at the time, Bill Gross, was dissatisfied with it, expressing his preference for a ticker like BND, Vanguard's bond ETF. A bit later, the ticker BOND became available, and the ETF was rebranded accordingly. While TRXT was already attracting investment due to Bill Gross and PIMCO's reputations, the rebranding to BOND further accelerated its growth. A significant shift occurred when a derivatives rule change was implemented in the U.S, shifting the cap from a notional one to a Value at Risk (VAR) limit. Previously, mutual funds could use derivatives, but the type didn't matter and the amount was capped at notional values. This discouraged the use of derivatives for things like foreign exchange and long short strategies. The derivatives rule change made it possible for riskier exposures to be leveraged against low volatility assets, which helped create more interesting and useful strategies. The change also aligned U.S regulations with European ones, democratizing the investment opportunities previously available only to wealthy individuals through hedge funds or CTAs and made portfolio allocations more efficient. Strategies were developed to invest in US large cap exposure through passive S&P 500 ETFs, acknowledging the difficulty and rarity of successful stock picking. Noting that the S&P 500 routinely outperforms most active managers, these strategies aim to modify distribution in order to protect against market downturns. The method involves investing around 2-3% per annum into insurance, specifically buying deep out of the money puts. Options were identified as an interesting tool in this model, allowing one-sided risk management and facilitating a designed outcome within known expenditure limits. The consideration behind this involved taking S&P 500 beta exposure and protecting it with an options overlay. Usually, this insurance investment doesn't pay off the majority of the years but when it does, it's most beneficial, acting as a diversifier during downturns, thereby enabling an investor to buy the dip and simultaneously providing downside protection. This strategy is used particularly within the RIA world due to the ease of buying ETFs versus signing up for an option overlay. The effectiveness of this approach was tested using US large caps and an option overlay was incorporated within the ETF. The original idea was to dedicate about 2% per annum, or approximately 50 basis points per quarter, to buy out of the money puts. However, understanding that more than half of the market drawdowns extend for longer, they decided to allocate some of the budget to long-dated options to protect against prolonged drawdowns such as the Great Depression with some allocated to shorter-dated options for sudden drawdowns like in March 2020. The complexity of managing all these variables led to the creation of an infrastructure and back testing profile for efficient laddered exposures. The adoption of long puts into put spreads offers the potential for significant protection for investors. This strategy has been iteratively developed by active portfolio managers and is not indexed, making it quite intricate. The overlay of this strategy is critical, given its function to provide insurance in the current market atmosphere. An analogy to this iterative process is akin to various software versions, with the current version being around 2.5. This strategy doesn’t require accepting asset classes and outcomes as-is, rather, it presents a myriad of possible results with different levels of exposure through derivatives. This opens up a broad menu of choices for investors, rather than keeping them restricted to the prepackaged conditions of buying S&P (like the wrapper SPY). One of the more significant strategies in play recently has been focused on hedging against interest rates. When funds are at zero and rates are at all-time lows, it is a mostly one-sided bet that interest rates will eventually rise. Hedging options include inverse treasury ETFs, selling futures, or buying puts on bonds or ETFs. Each of these options has drawbacks, from being linear and not truly providing a hedge, to being expensive or involving the drain of shorting the exposure. Harley Bassman, an ex-PIMCO expert on volatility and options, provided some insight into these strategies. He appreciated the idea of long calls within an ETF (upside convexity) and proposed an idea of his own. He suggested creating an ETF that leveraged swaptions as an efficient hedge against major movements in interest rates. The challenge was how to incorporate swaption – interest rate derivatives – into an ETF and manage that with ISDAs, which aren't commonly available. Despite this, Harley Bassman likened the idea to a Formula One racer, implying it's a high-performance strategy that ordinary investors could access. Investments, particularly ETFs, can be hedged against rising rates without the risk of negative carry costs. This strategy has been successful due to the excessive supply of options compared to buyers. However, acquiring these exposures requires purchasing them OTC, potentially presenting a challenge to managers. This approach opens up greater investment versatility in other areas such as total return swaps on equities, long short exposures, and lever exposures. Additionally, increasing interest rates can create additional duration risk not just in fixed income, but in most risk assets. Therefore, utilizing ETFs as an efficient protection against significant increases in interest rates is important. Especially as historically, rates of 4% to 5% are considered normal, the focused ETFs protection could go up from 10%-20% to hundreds of percent in such a scenario. On the other hand, this isn't suggested as a day trading option but a portfolio level interest rate hedge. The implementation of such strategies is a mix of brainstorming, investor input, and the input from professionals with different backgrounds - including team members from Convexity Capital and PIMCO, respectively. Mike Green's perspective on market structure also adds to the diversity, making the exposure interesting. Thus, the collective contribution of these individuals and stakeholders make such a strategy efficient and successful. The dialogue primarily revolves around the launch of a new fund CTA. Despite being the smallest fund due to its recent inception, it is fittingly appreciated for its ticker code. The discussion then shifts to CDX, a high-yield credit hedge ETF. The initial idea was to complement PFIX, an interest rate hedge, with a credit hedge by investing in options. However, due to the relative illiquidity of the market and CDX options, this approach proved difficult to implement. Consequently, approaches like buying puts on HYG or other ETFs were considered. Still, the negative carry associated with buying protection through relatively illiquid markets did not make it an attractive option. Thus, the plan was withdrawn and started anew with the addition of Mike Green, who proposed long-short exposures as viable credit hedge strategies once the ISDAs were in place. This approach mitigates premium payments and performs well in significant market sell-offs. The strategy provides an anti-correlated hedge to credit by going long on quality while going short on high-leveraged junk names. Furthermore, put spreads or a little bit of options can be added to maintain a neutral to positive carrying credit hedge that functions well even under trends of high yield ETFs. The promising growth of the relatively young shop is also stressed upon. Despite complex strategies involving options, swaps, or swaptions inducing an apprehensive response from many market players, the organizations remain hopeful of growth as the schemes gain traction with time. Investors at all levels face the same challenge of finding attractive sources of returns and income among high-risk, high-valuation equities, low-yielding bonds, and numerous credit risks. Yet, investments must be made, urging investors to consider various strategies, including downside hedges. This holds true whether for the world's largest pension fund, a $10 billion registered investment advisor (RIA), or a $5 million advisor. The exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sector has proposed to solve these issues, communicating not only with advisors, but with large institutions too. One notable ETF is the Simplify Equity Plus GBTC, which aims to offer advisors a way to expose their clients to digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, through Grayscale. The ETF holds a 10% allocation to Grayscale, chosen due to its limited options for gaining crypto or Bitcoin exposure when first listed. The combination of US large-cap exposure and Bitcoin exposure is designed to offer diversification within SEC limitations, while all rebalancing is taken care of. Despite decent early traction, the ETF has not been as revolutionary or asset-gathering as it potentially could have been. Bitcoin's accessibility is still in its early stages with various ways to gain access including futures-based strategy. GBTC, a closed-end fund, is mentioned as an interesting option for investment due to its ability to rebalance following a risk-off environment, even despite higher expense ratios. The trading discount of 30% presents opportunities for investors who strategically place limit orders every 10% down. Bitcoin futures also carries the downside of a negative carry that includes a 20% drag due to the annual cost of holding a futures-based strategy. Especially in comparison to the 2% expense ratio of holding physical Bitcoin. The text also speaks about a healthcare ETF with the ticker "Pink" managed by Mike Taylor, which donates its entire expense ratio to Susan G Komen annually. Despite its performance and charitable contribution, it hasn’t drawn significant assets. The text mentions a surprise that cause-driven investment vehicles like this haven't gained more traction, given their potential for both financial and social benefit. The ESG focus has primarily been on climate change, obscuring other important issues. The arrival of a non-climate change-related ETF is challenging the dominant narrative and may lead to a shift in institutional perspectives. Despite uncertainty around its launch, there are hopes that it could have a significant impact on tackling other issues surrounding cancer. Investing in ETFs comes with an element of unpredictability but the potential for high returns is an attractive risk. The focus now shifts to reshaping how portfolios are considered, challenging the standard practices of asset classes, non-linear exposures and return stacking. Traditional thinking could be at risk as new complexities emerge including inflation, geopolitical risk, and market structure. Building better portfolios that get someone from a first year at work to retirement is the new objective. Recognizing the need to think beyond risk and linear views to considering downside risks and non-linear payoffs, there is potential to revisit portfolio construction. The increasing disruptions across industries, including finance and fintech, are driving these changes. The ETF is seen as the fintech of asset management, providing innovative strategies and entry points for those outside of traditional scope. Simplify, a company that thinks about building better portfolios, plans to explore opportunities in the retirement world, models world, and models construction. However, they admit that the market still needs to play out and certain conditions need to be met for their strategies to be successful.

The conversation now shifts to uncover a surprise - cause-driven investment vehicles like Simplify's thematic healthcare ETF haven't gained more traction, despite their potential for both financial and social benefit. This is due to the dominant ESG focus on climate change, which obscures other important issues. However, the arrival of a non-climate change-related ETF like Simplify's challenges the narrative and may lead to a shift in institutional perspectives. With hopes of making a significant impact on addressing issues surrounding cancer, the potential for high returns makes investing in ETFs an attractive risk. As new complexities emerge, including inflation, geopolitical risk, and market structure, traditional thinking could be at risk, and the focus now turns to reshaping how portfolios are considered, challenging standard practices and seeking innovative strategies.

Evolution in Portfolio Management: The Ongoing Impact of ETFs and the Derivatives Rule Change
Introduction: A Continuing New Dawn in Investment Strategies
The landscape of investment and portfolio management is continuing to undergo revolutionary transformation, driven by the advent of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that offer innovative, protective strategies at accessible prices. This change is largely facilitated by a pivotal shift in the regulatory environment, specifically the Derivatives Rule change, which has expanded the horizons of what's possible within the wrapper of ETFs.
Democratizing Esoteric Investment Strategies
For years, the most advanced investment strategies were the exclusive domain of hedge funds and institutional investors, largely inaccessible to the average investor due to their complexity and cost. However, the integration of options into ETFs has changed the game, allowing investors to access the potential benefits of what were once esoteric strategies. This model of reassembling value within an ETF format not only brings hedge fund-type exposures and tail risk strategies to a broader audience but does so with tax efficiency and without exorbitant fees.
The Catalyst: The Derivatives Rule Change
The derivatives rule change, a monumental shift in the regulatory framework, now allows for increased use of derivatives and leverage in a 40 Act offering. Moving from a notional cap to a Value at Risk (VAR) limit, this change has made it possible to leverage riskier exposures to low volatility assets, creating more intriguing and beneficial strategies. This alignment with European regulations democratizes investment opportunities, making sophisticated portfolio allocations more efficient and accessible.
Innovating Portfolio Protection
Investors now have the tools to protect their portfolios against market downturns in ways previously impracical for all but the most sophisticated or large funds. Strategies that involve buying deep out-of-the-money puts as insurance, once thought to be impractical for the average investor, are now being incorporated into ETFs. These strategies, designed to offer downside protection while enabling investors to capitalize on market dips, have proven especially valuable in the RIA space. The adoption of put spreads, for instance, underscores the potential for significant investor protection, highlighting the critical role of ETFs in providing market insurance.
Beyond Traditional Asset Management
The introduction of ETFs that hedge against interest rates and credit risks illustrates the sector's innovative leap. With the backdrop of historically low interest rates, the strategies for hedging have evolved, incorporating instruments like swaptions into ETFs for high-performance interest rate hedging. Moreover, the approach towards managing credit risks, through buying puts on high-yield ETFs or utilizing long-short exposures, reflects a sophisticated strategy to maintain a neutral to positive carry.
The Future of Portfolio Construction
The advent of ETFs offering advanced hedging and protective strategies is just the beginning. The sector is poised to reshape portfolio management by challenging traditional asset class practices, advocating for non-linear exposures, and promoting a return stacking approach. This shift towards more dynamic, resilient portfolio construction is in response to emerging complexities in the market, including inflation and geopolitical risks. ETFs are emerging as the fintech of asset management, ushering in a new era where innovative strategies are not just possible but accessible to investors beyond the traditional investment scope.
Conclusion: Embracing the Transformation
The evolution of portfolio management through ETFs, catalyzed by the Derivatives Rule change, represents a significant milestone in democratizing sophisticated investment strategies. As we look to the future, the focus on innovative, protective strategies within ETFs promises not only to enhance portfolio resilience but also to redefine the very foundation of portfolio construction. This transformation, driven by regulatory changes and the ingenuity of ETF structures, marks a pivotal moment in the journey towards more inclusive, efficient, and strategic investment management.



ORIGNIAL TEXT SUMMARY:

In this comprehensive discussion on the fluctuating market trends and their effects on valuation strategies, we delve into the intricacies of the changing dynamics between growth and value stocks, and their consequent impact on relative performance. With a primary focus on the perplexing phenomena seen between 2007 and 2020, we seek to unpick the events of the longest and driest period in history for value investment. During this time, the dominance of growth stocks, epitomized by entities like Nvidia, superseded most market activity. 

The marked increase in the divergence between growth and value stocks during this period is noteworthy. The spread in price to book between growth and value stocks, using Russell Growth and Russell Value indexes as indicators, skyrocketed from 4:1 in 2007 to 13:1 by 2020, surpassing even the 10:1 peak during the tech bubble. This suggests an even more intensified tech bubble scenario, especially since the relative performance of Russell Value decreased significantly compared to Russell Growth. Despite this, there were certain bright spots - for instance, an unexpected improvement in the underlying fundamentals relative to growth. The 'migration effect', a phenomenon where value stocks get replaced with deeper value stocks, led to a faster rise in the dividend stream of a Russell Value portfolio from 2007-2022 than that of a Russell Growth portfolio. An academic exploration of this trend was conducted under the project 'Reports of Value's Death may have been greatly exaggerated', and the paper produced subsequently was acknowledged extensively for its insights.

While value stocks took a hit, interestingly, value companies demonstrated resilience. Contrary to narratives suggesting that tech companies would flourish at the expense of traditional brick-and-mortar firms, reality painted a different picture with many value businesses faring well in the face of pandemic and stimulus checks. 

However, the recent growth year-to-date has been largely attributed to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) sector. This narrative mirrors the internet boom of 2000, where the internet was hailed as an all-encompassing business catalyst. Today, stakes are high on AI to replicate this pattern of revolution. 

In an overview of some leading market products, we discuss partnerships with FTSE, FTSE Russell and Raffi. In 2005, FTSE adopted the fundamental index concept that later became a main profit engine. Russell launched a similar yet complimentary product referred to as "first cousins", which furthered the impact. A collaboration after FTSE's acquisition of Russell resulted in FTSE Raffi and Russell Raffi, managing over $100 billion. 

Despite facing a rough decade in the 2010s, Raffi has marked an upswing in performance since the advent of the COVID crisis and its general launch. It's been seen that cap-weighted indexes, which accurately reflect the stock market's look, performance, and composition, tend to reflect momentum and growth rather than the macroeconomic state of the publicly traded companies. Conversely, RAFI weighs companies based on their economic footprint and may oscillate between being a value or a growth portfolio depending on the market situation. 

A final thought leads us to a re-evaluation of stock valuation techniques. Composite measurements such as price to sales, price to cash flow, price to book, and price to dividends plus buybacks can lend a more accurate assessment of a company's value. With intelligible use, they can compensate for their individual limitations - for instance, the issue of book value not accounting for intangible assets. A more comprehensive strategy including investments in R&D to the book value and amortizing it could provide a better evaluation of a firm's worth. In the turbulent waves of the investment market, intelligent strategizing and a deeper understanding of these complex dynamics can steer one towards solid ground. Concluding the discourse, the phenomena of market dynamics demand continuous learning and adaption. The value lies not only in the financial stakes but also in the wisdom gained along the journey.

Title: Deciphering Market Dynamics: Growth, Value, and the RAFI Approach
Punchline: It’s very hard to know
The ongoing debate between growth and value investing ultimately leaves us with more questions than answers. Can we accurately time the market to favor certain factors? Possibly, but it's a challenge best tackled by professionals wielding powerful computers. The key takeaway, however, is the irreplaceable value of resilience—maintaining your investment course even in the face of market downturns.
Introduction: Equity Markets in Transition
Equity markets were up huge in 2023, led mainly by tech stock (SPY and QQQ both have more than 30% of their index in 7 stocks) . This coming after a very disappointing 2022, especially for devotees of the traditional “60/40” portfolio. So there is ongoing discussion and debate about which styles and strategies are most appropriate going forward.  And as we’ve been discussing, there is an ongoing explosion in thematic and otherwise active ETFs
But one of the most evergreen conversations relates to the Growth vs Value factor tilt.
The Growth vs. Value Conundrum
The choice between growth and value investing remains a pivotal, yet elusive, decision for investors. While the long-term significance of this choice may be debatable, exploring these factors offers both educational value and potential tactical advantages. Engaging computers for timing and weighting adjustments could offer a sophisticated edge, though the paramount strategy remains steadfast participation in the market, especially through volatility.
Shifting Market Dynamics
Many may not realize that the roughly 40 year period between 1985 and 2024 shows overall very similar results for Value vs Growth.That said, between 2007 and 2020, growth stocks, exemplified by tech giants, overshadowed their value counterparts, challenging traditional valuation metrics.The spread in price to book between growth and value stocks, using Russell Growth and Russell Value indexes as indicators, skyrocketed from 4:1 in 2007 to 13:1 by 2020, surpassing even the 10:1 peak during the 1999 internet bubble. This suggests an even more intensified tech bubble scenario, especially since the relative performance of Russell Value decreased significantly compared to Russell Growth.The recent growth boom has been largely attributed to the burgeoning and booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector. This narrative mirrors the internet boom of 2000, where the internet was hailed as an all-encompassing business catalyst. Today, bets are high on AI to replicate this pattern of revolution.
Despite this, there were certain bright spots for growth - for instance, an unexpected improvement in the underlying fundamentals relative to growth. The 'migration effect', a phenomenon where value stocks get replaced with deeper value stocks, led to a faster rise in the dividend stream of a Russell Value portfolio from 2007-2022 than that of a Russell Growth portfolio.
Beyond Cap-Weighted Indexes
The RAFI methodology pioneered by Research Affiliates presents a compelling alternative to traditional cap-weighted indexes, which often emphasize momentum and growth, potentially at the expense of a comprehensive view of the market's economic fundamentals. By focusing on a company's economic footprint, the RAFI approach introduces a dynamic balance, allowing portfolios to adapt between growth and value orientations based on the prevailing market conditions. This strategy reflects a nuanced understanding of market dynamics, prioritizing economic substance over market sentiment.
Enhancing Investment Strategies
The differentiation between RAFI and cap-weighted indexes underlines the importance of evolving valuation techniques.Composite measurements such as price to sales, price to cash flow, price to book, and price to dividends plus buybacks can lend a more accurate assessment of a company's value.This approach, especially when incorporating intangibles like R&D investment, paves the way for more informed and strategic investment decisions.
Conclusion: Embracing a Holistic Perspective
The ongoing debate between growth and value investing, enriched by the insights from RAFI's methodology, underscores the complexity of today's market environment. As investors navigate this terrain, the emphasis shifts towards a more comprehensive analysis of market trends and investment strategies. The journey through these market dynamics is not just about financial returns but also about the continuous evolution of investment philosophy and practice.
